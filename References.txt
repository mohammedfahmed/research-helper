year={2017}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={219-224}, 
abstract={Edge windowing is a windowing technique for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signals based on the idea of using shorter cyclic prefix (CP) and longer window lengths at the edge subcarriers while keeping the symbol length fixed. In this study, we investigate the performance of OFDM signals with edge windowing under non-linear power amplifier (PA) effects by observing out-of-band (OOB) emission characteristics, average error vector magnitude (EVM) and coded block error rate (BLER) performance. We explore whether the possible gains over conventional windowing in the presence of PA is possible. We show that the edge windowing can still provide improvements over conventional windowing in terms of OOB emission suppression under various PA models at the expense of increased average EVM, whereas the channel coding substantially mitigates the performance loss due to inter-symbol and inter-carrier interference (ISI-ICI) effects arising as a result of shorter CP length at the edge subcarriers.},

year={2017}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={775-781}, 
abstract={This paper presents system concept, calibration and example measurements of a novel ultra-wideband, real-time channel sounder. The sounder operates in the frequency range from 3 GHz to 18 GHz thus providing a Fourier delay resolution of 66.7 ps. The developed sounder measures overlapping sub-bands of 1 GHz bandwidth to cover the whole frequency range. This allows us to use a waveform generator and a digitizer with relatively lower sample rates and significantly lowers the cost compared to sampling the whole band at once. With the transmit power of 40 dBm, the maximum measurable path loss is 132 dB without accounting possible antenna gains. In this work, we also describe the calibration procedure along with the method to patch sub-bands into a combined channel response. This approach is validated by comparing the results from vector network analyzer(VNA) measurements performed in the same static environment. In contrast to VNAs, however, our sounder is real-time and can measure in dynamic environments with maximum Doppler spreads up to 166.7 Hz. Additionally, we present sample results from the first measurement campaign performed in an urban cellular scenario covering 3-18 GHz.},

pages={587-591}, 
abstract={There has been a significant increase in the number of sensors deployed to accomplish military missions. These sensors might be on manned or unmanned resources, and might collect quantitative and/or qualitative information important for mission success. Of critical importance for mission success is ensuring that the collected information is routed to the people/systems that need the information for the proper making of decisions. For military applications, routing of information across a communication network has typically been accomplished using fixed, a priori defined, routing paths. When bandwidth between resources is unlimited, this presents no problems. However, in bandwidth constrained environments, when not all information is able to be routed across the network, then fixed routing paths presents limitations in information reaching appropriate consumers. In this research, we consider the advantages to using dynamic shortest temporal path routes for the information, as opposed to fixed routing paths. Multiple metrics show empirically the benefit to dynamic shortest path routes.},

abstract={Today, rapid business and technology innovations are producing an array of advanced commercial satellite communications (COMSATCOM) systems that can deliver massive amounts of SATCOM capacity at a fraction of current cost and offer communications diversity that is critical for achieving resilience in a military contested environment. Recognizing the alignment of commercial capabilities with the Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for high capacity, global coverage, lower cost, and resilience, the department is proactively engaging the industry to formulate strategies leading towards a DoD Wideband SATCOM Enterprise that efficiently acquires and effectively manages advanced commercial capabilities in its architecture. To fully leverage the expanded space resources, the DoD must also address the integration of commercial waveforms into the DoD tactical terminals. The terminal flexibility for operating across multiple operator networks, in multiple frequency bands, and support different waveforms/modems is not only a pre-requisite for accessing advanced services but also key in providing resilience against threats. The purpose of this paper is to provide an architectural overview of the flexible terminal and Flexible Modem Interface (FMI) concepts. The FMI enables managed terminal flexibility and should be considered as an important step in converging DoD tactical terminal segment capabilities for various types of satellite networks and managed services.},

abstract={Underwater communication with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has strong demands on the modems caused by the constantly changing signal propagation (multi-path propagation, scattering, diffraction and refraction at thermal layers, etc.) of the underwater channel. These demands typically lead to a modem designed to match specific conditions. In this paper we present an automated model-based physical layer implementation approach of an underwater acoustic passband modem using QPSK. This paper presents a possibility to automatically simulate, validate and synthesize a physical layer implementation with a significantly improved ease-of-use, maintainability and extensibility of the developed modems. The results are based on a prototype with six variants of adapted Reed Solomon and convolutional en-/decoders, developed and implemented in hardware on an Altera FPGA. In this work we show that the implemented prototype requires up to 88.7 % less energy for the same or better functionality compared to the Micromodem-2. In addition we show that our hardware can be used immediately in the area of long-distance communication based on a SNR test and in areas of high multi-path propagation based on channel simulation using BELLHOP.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the performance of a generic relay system for small cells. The main features include the selection decode-and-forward (DF) scheme, Rician and Rayleigh fading, single or repeated transmissions in direct link, and maximal-ratio combining at destination. We are able to derive a set of closed-form expressions for the end-to-end performance. Based on these formulas, we define a metric, called the differential outage probability (DOP), to characterize the differential performance due to repetition coding. It is shown that the benefit of repetition diminishes quickly when the components of line-of-sight (LOS) increase.},

abstract={Range extension via the use of small aircraft with highly directional antennas that act as relays is a topic of interest in military network technology development. Antenna elements in such designs typically have limited field-of-view (FoV), potentially making interconnectedness among communication nodes dependent on the geometry of the physical network. This paper examines a generic sectorized pod antenna design and compares the interconnectedness and link availability of these designs in representative range extension network layouts. A heuristic for determining quantitative trade-offs between link availability and node interconnectedness is developed. Results from this heuristic show that both interconnectedness and availability increase with a decreasing number of antenna sectors, and that a marginal azimuthal overlap increases average link availability substantially in two representative scenarios.},

abstract={The goal of this paper is to expand from previously researched liquid metal linear array models into a dynamically driven two dimensional liquid metal array. Simulations were performed using FEKO to prove the concept that a multi-dimensional array will provide the user more control over the direction of the main beam and also the direction of the nulls, making the resulting array useful for spatially tracking signals and mitigating interference. A proof-of-concept hardware model of the 2D array antenna was built and tested in the context of a dual frequency dual frequency GPS antenna (L1, L2/L5) with results found comparable to simulation. Since the antennas are made from liquid metal, these results make it possible for the user to change the parasitic elements within the 2D array from negligible (height of zero) to directors, to reflectors, or back with the use of a syringe or pump. This spatially adaptable antenna also benefits from the use of a single digitizer chain, offering a concrete alternative for anti-jam GPS antennas as the technology matures.},

pages={641-646}, 
abstract={In this paper, the problem of single-channel blind source separation (SCBSS) of a mixture of two co-frequency phase-shift keying (PSK) signals with unknown carrier frequency offsets (CFOs) is investigated. Two SCBSS algorithms which are robust to CFOs are proposed to perform separation of the mixture signals. In the first algorithm, the phase changes of the received signals caused by CFOs are tracked when performing separation of the signals. In the second algorithm, the CFOs are estimated directly before separation by using the cyclostationary feature of the signal, and they are used as known values during the separation of the signals. Simulation results show that both of the two proposed algorithms lead to significant performance improvement as compared with that achieved by using the conventional SCBSS algorithm. When CFOs are small, the phase tracking based algorithm is preferred as it can achieve same performance as that achieved by using the cyclic-feature based algorithm, but with much lower complexity. When CFOs are big, the cyclic-feature based algorithm is a better choice because it can achieve much better performance than that achieved by using the phase tracking based algorithm.},

abstract={The generation of pseudorandom number sequences can be achieved in a variety of ways, with the most secure methods generally requiring substantial processing to generate. Other pseudorandom number generation (PRNG) methods accept a compromise between processing power and security by mixing two independent, but less secure, PRNG outputs with each other. This paper presents a generalized mixing method for any number of PRNG streams using Galois Extension Field techniques that achieves maximal entropy when conditioned on any individual input, making the reverse engineering of the combined result exceedingly difficult. In addition to this basic mixing method, enhanced adaptations are presented that further improve the output while using simple bit-level statistical operators.},

abstract={The High Performance Waveform (HPW) was developed before parallel concatenated codes (PCCC) and serial concatenated codes (SCCC) were in wide use and so it makes sense to take advantage of the advancements in communication theory and processor computation speed that have taken place since its inception. In its current form, HPW transmits a Raised-Cosine Continuous Phase Modulation (1RC CPM) modulation with a trellis code that is designed to provide, with the use of a Cyclic Redundancy Check Code error detection (CRC), error free transmission over a single, narrowband UHF satellite communications channel. In this paper we present an additional set of coding and modulation schemes which take advantage of serial concatenated code (SCCC) technology to simultaneously improve throughput at the lower end of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range while increasing the highest throughput at the highest SNR available on UHF satellites. The overall bit error rate and throughput of each individual modulation type is analyzed and the framework for the adaptive modulation protocol is provided. To provide for a gradual release of a newer revision of HPW, a framework for a PHY layer is provided which will allow a heterogeneous network of legacy and updated radio terminals.},

pages={623-628}, 
abstract={A joint radar-communication (JRC) system can provide cost-effective and spectrum-efficient platform solution with simultaneous operation, while accomplishing important tasks, sensing via radar processing and allocation of communication links. Existing modulation techniques where information embedding is achieved using sidelobe Amplitude-Shift Keying (ASK) for the JRC system are not investigated so far under fading channels and an optimum threshold estimation algorithm is yet to be developed. Specifying an optimum threshold level under fading can become a comprehensive problem, especially for mobile communication systems. In this paper, a novel non-data aided (NDA) threshold estimation technique and a receiver design are introduced. Furthermore, a new sidelobe ASK modulation technique is proposed for utilizing JRC system for mobile platforms under fading. Proposed modulation technique implements dual Sidelobe Level (SLL) ASK with waveform diversity by exploiting multiple orthogonal waveforms. One pair is modulated with dual SLL in amplitude rotational manner and initiates NDA threshold estimation process at the receiver. This method utilizes K bits of information using only K + 1 orthogonal waveform. The performance of the proposed technique is investigated in terms of the bit error rate (BER) and data rate. Simulations reveal that the operation of proposed method coupled with NDA threshold estimation process can reach more data rate, since it exhibits almost the same BER performance as existing methods under fading channel without requiring more orthogonal waveform.},

abstract={A key focus of wireless communications research is on solutions that catalyze broadband access everywhere at anytime. Relaying has been introduced as a solution to enable communication between users who suffer from poor channel conditions. Distributed relay networks are a special case where spatial diversity is obtained by using a relay consisting of many geographically dispersed nodes. Due to bandwidth constraints, distributed relay networks perform quantization at the relay nodes, and hence they are referred to as quantized distributed relay networks. In such systems, users transmit data simultaneously through the uplink to the relay nodes of the relay. Each node independently quantizes the observed signal to a few bits and broadcasts these bits through the band-limited downlink channel to the users. In this paper, we consider a multi-way quantized distributed relay network where the relay facilitates the communication between many users. For decoding purposes, we develop algorithms that can be employed by the users to estimate their uplink channels as well as the uplink channels observed by all other users when nodes perform simple sign quantization. A near maximum likelihood (nearML) channel estimator is derived. In addition, other sub-optimal estimators that are more computationally efficient than the nearML technique are also presented. Via simulation, we compare the performance of the proposed channel estimators.},

abstract={Device-to-device (D2D) communication has been proposed as a solution for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, which has strict requirements on reliability and latency. Previous works on V2V communication typically assume single-antenna users, which ignore the potential of multiple antennas. By contrast, this paper studies an uplink power control problem in multi-antenna V2V underlay cellular networks. We first derive the lower bounds on ergodic rates of multi-antenna V2V users and cellular users for maximum-ratio combining and zero-forcing detection. Using these rate lower bounds, we formulate a large-scale fading based power control problem to maximize the sum rate of cellular users while introducing the rate constraints of V2V users. Moreover, the geometric programming technique is adopted to solve the optimization power control problem. Simulation results show that the proposed rate-constrained power control scheme provides more reliable V2V communications with higher data rates at the price of a small loss of network sum rate, compared to the fixed maximum power scheme.},

abstract={Cloud-fog radio access is a promising technology in evolving wireless communication systems, but its success depends on security. It is fundamental to conduct the secrecy analysis in the physical layer due to the special architecture of CF-RAN. In this paper, we investigate the secrecy impacted by general path-loss effects. We show that the mathematical kernel is the Weibull distribution function with non-integer parameters. This type of problems was challenging since it is not covered in popular mathematical handbooks. However, with the aid of a recently discovered result in the literature, we are able to solve this issue and derive the solution in the closed-form. The presented results provide the necessary facility to expedite the secrecy analysis for other variants of CF-RAN. The simulation shows that the impact of path-loss fading on secrecy is more significant than that of deployed device intensity.},

abstract={MU-MIMO beamforming offers great potential for the AP with multiple antennas to serve multiple receivers concurrently. A key factor to implement the MU-MIMO system is the CSI feedback mechanism. However, it might be exploited by malicious attackers to threaten the transmission security of benign clients. To better explore the attacks through false CSI feedback in MU-MIMO systems, this paper proposes a mathematically formulated strategy of eavesdropping attack, called polynomial attack. Based on the basic polynomial attack strategy, we investigate two kinds of advanced polynomial attacks: the passive polynomial attack and the active polynomial attack. They are discriminated by the different abilities in approaching to the eavesdropped victims. Besides proving the attack effects theoretically, we also develop defensive methods against the two attacks. Especially against the active attack, we propose a novel MU-MIMO scheme called AntiPoly, under which each client holds a pair of constant keys. One is the feedback key used for interacting with the AP in the CSI training period, and the other one is the transmission key used for decoding signals in the transmission period. With intensive experiments performed on actual measured CSI, the attack effects of polynomial attacks are illustrated, and our developed defensive methods are validated.},

pages={285-290}, 
abstract={Software Defined Networking (SDN) is rapidly gaining acceptance and use in terrestrial networks but little research has been done to apply it to aerial networks. This paper describes an investigation into five open-source controllers using a specific set of criteria based on the characteristics of these networks. A preliminary qualitative investigation compares the controllers based on their state handling and failure recovery mechanisms, resulting in the selection of two controllers for further investigation. Further quantitative tests were performed on these controllers to determine which was more suitable for deployment in an airborne environment. Key aspects such as controller failure recovery and the resultant generated traffic were analyzed and quantified. Due to the much lower bandwidth in aerial networks when compared to terrestrial networks, a low-bandwidth solution with high recovery speed and adaptability is required. This investigation takes these factors into account and gives insight into which open-source controller would be best as a starting point for use in this highly constrained environment.},

abstract={Tactical cloudlets are forward-deployed, discoverable, virtual-machine-based servers that can be hosted on vehicles or other platforms to provide a computation offload and data staging infrastructure for mobile devices in the field. Because of the mobility of cloudlets in the field, as well as dynamic missions, a mobile user of a cloudlet might need to migrate active capabilities (computation and data) to another trusted cloudlet. A common solution for establishing trust between two nodes is to create and share credentials in advance, and then use a third-party, online trusted authority to validate the credentials of the nodes. However, the characteristics of tactical environments do not consistently provide access to that third-party authority or certificate repository because they are DIL environments (disconnected, intermittent, limited). The goal of this paper is to present a solution for secure VM migration between tactical cloudlets based on secure key generation and exchange in the field.},

year={2017}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={489-494}, 
abstract={NarrowBand Waveforms (NBWF) are often used in VHF or UHF tactical communications. For these kinds of waveforms, low latency and robust data rates result in short codeword lengths that are challenging in terms of channel coding. Usually, serially concatenated convolutional code and continuous phase modulation (CC-CPM) schemes are considered in the context of NBWF. When evaluating the achievable rates, CC-CPM schemes show a 1 to 4 dB maximum margin. In this paper, we investigate on two new sparse graph-based channel coding strategies, trying to reduce this degradation for the achievable rate. Some implementation issues with short codeword lengths are also addressed. To this end, we first consider a serially concatenated CPM scheme where the outer code is an optimized Low-Density Parity-Check code (LDPC) based on some recently introduced methods for this kind of applications. The optimized LDPC scheme exhibits a good bit error rate when binary CPMs are used. This new design comes with lower computational complexity and greater flexibility. Second, in order to avoid the cubersome of iterative detection and decoding, we investigate on recently introduced precoded CPM that can achieve near optimal performance, referred to us as Pragmatic CPM (P-CPM). For this kind of precoded CPM schemes, we will show that associated EXIT chart curves have the flat property. It means that, to achieve good performance, P-CPM can be used with standard capacity approaching codes like LDPC Accumulate Repeat Jagged Accumulate (ARJA) or Turbo Codes without the need for iterative decoding. Bit error rate simulations confirm that P-CPM is a reliable alternative NBWF scheme compatible with versatile modern channel codes. As P-CPM is non-iterative, implementation is made easier. In additive white Gaussian noise, both schemes are found practical.},

abstract={HF ionospherical channels are very challenging due to their time and frequency selective, and highly varying natures. Furthermore, they offer only limited data rates, which led generations of engineers to limit the signalization information and to reduce the number of turnarounds to preserve a maximum throughput for useful data. However, new wideband modems [1] [2] have recently been proposed, that achieve much higher data rates and a much better resilience on the HF link, leading to re-assess such traditional strategies. This paper presents a protocol relying on a time division approach, which can follow very closely the channel variations between two stations for only a limited signaling overhead, and as such allows to optimize the transmissions. Experimental results are given, that demonstrate the interest of such an approach over various ionospherical HF channels.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose novel user clustering schemes for downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, where an N-antenna base station (BS) selects and serves 2N users from K single antenna user equipments (UEs) (K ≥ 2N and K is even). In particular, we propose a signal difference and alignment (SDA) framework to achieve fair and spectral efficient user clustering for NOMA with flexible performance-complexity tradeoff. To be more specific, the BS sorts UEs according to their large-scale fading (LSF) gains and selects N primary UEs with the highest LSF gains to guide the downlink zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) vector. Then the BS selects N complementary UEs from the second half of the sorted UE set based on the principle of signal space alignment (SSA). Unlike conventional user scheduling, SDA framework uses the ordered set to create signal strength difference for NOMA while employing opportunistic SSA method to select complementary UEs with minimal inter-cluster interference leakage. Moreover, the SDA framework can enable distributed implementation with graceful performance at lower system overhead. Numerical results verify that the proposed schemes improve the performance in downlink NOMA system.},

abstract={Abnormal activity sensing has attracted increasing research attention in military surveillance, patient monitoring, and health care of children and elderly, etc. Researchers have exploited the characteristics of wireless signals to sense “keystrokes” and “human talks”, relieving the privacy invasion concern caused by mounting the surveillance cameras or wearing the smart devices. However, existing technologies usually require some specialized hardware, and can only sense a fixed set of pre-defined activities through a supervised learning from those wireless signals patterns. In this paper, we propose WarnFi, a non-invasive abnormal activity sensing system with only two commodity off-the-shelf (COTS) WiFi devices. The intuition of WarnFi is that whenever the human body occludes the wireless signal transmitting from the access point to the receiver, the time-series of Channel State Information (CSI) will experience a unique variation. By using a non-parametric model, WarnFi can dynamically cluster the human body activities for abnormal sensing. Extensive experiments in various scenarios demonstrate the satisfactory performance of WarnFi.},

abstract={New and unseen network attacks pose a great threat to the signature-based detection systems. Consequently, machine learning-based approaches are designed to detect attacks, which rely on features extracted from network data. The problem is caused by different distribution of features in the training and testing datasets, which affects the performance of the learned models. Moreover, generating labeled datasets is very time-consuming and expensive, which undercuts the effectiveness of supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we propose using transfer learning to detect previously unseen attacks. The main idea is to learn the optimized representation to be invariant to the changes of attack behaviors from labeled training sets and non-labeled testing sets, which contain different types of attacks and feed the representation to a supervised classifier. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to use a feature-based transfer learning technique to detect unseen variants of network attacks. Furthermore, this technique can be used with any common base classifier. We evaluated the technique on publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of transfer learning to detect new network attacks.},

pages={592-598}, 
abstract={The enterprise and tactical domains have distinct properties and requirements, and have thus evolved independently in incompatible ways. Today the network infrastructure has emerged to, in theory, enable interconnectivity between these domains at a global scale. Unfortunately, even in the presence of these communication capabilities and despite the benefits that each operational domain can gain from access to information held by the other, warfighters at the tactical edge and analysts in enterprise agencies continue to lack meaningful, realtime access to each other's information. The separate evolution of the two domains has led to clients that use different forms of identification and access control, systems that employ different applications and use different data formats, and networks that operate most efficiently under different protocols. To address these differences and the need to meaningfully bridge enterprise and tactical domains, we are developing a framework for Robust Operational Gateways Enabling Reachback/Reach-forward (ROGER). ROGER attempts to address the hard problems inherent in connecting disparate clients, services, and networks over potentially unreliable communication substrates, in a manner that not only enables connectivity where none was present before, but in a way that enables efficient, effective, safe, and reliable information discovery and sharing. Acknowledging the plurality of types and structures of networks, services, applications, and missions, ROGER provides a gateway framework rather than a specific gateway. This framework supports building gateways that enable safe reach-back and reach-forward across a large set of heterogeneous networks and systems. By enabling the selection and configuration of pluggable, context specific components, ROGER supports the instantiation of gateways customized for particular deployments. Multiple gateways can be chained to provide reach-back and reach-forward across widely different and geographi- ally dispersed networks.},

The described method is implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-6 ML605 FPGA and reduces processing time by more than four orders of magnitude less than hardware simulation techniques in regression testing and validation over billions of bits, shortening design turn around times and accelerating Physical layer based security development for wireless communication research. The described independent source approach utilizes a minimal amount of board resources, allowing it to be integrated seamlessly into SDR hardware designs. Experimental validation of the independent source based BER calculation is performed for an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing signal, and a comparison between different stages of hardware design for the execution time required for BER testing of a large number of bits is provided.},

abstract={Standard applications are unable to perform well in delay- and disruption-tolerant networks (DTNs) due to frequent lack of end-to-end connectivity and long communication delays. Such applications must be thus adapted to be able to operate in disadvantageous network conditions. In a previous work on adapting standard tactical applications for DTN networks, we proposed how such an adaptation may be achieved in a transparent way. In this paper, we present results from field tests in a radio-based military DTN, deployed in a mountainous area of Greding (Germany). We discuss conclusions and lessons learned from the test: What we succeeded to achieve and what could be improved to make the tests more complete and valuable.},

The network node design is implementable on a software defined radio (SDR), such as the Nutaq PicoSDR. The contribution of this work is the prototype design and mapping of the design to the hardware and software architecture of the SDR, with a focus on the estimated delay in switching to a new frequency channel. The frequency switching delay is the result of systematic delays arising from the SDR platform, compounded by delays in the protocols enabling DSA, the gathering of sensing data from network nodes, and the dissemination of the frequency change command throughout the network.},

pages={46-51}, 
abstract={Traditional cryptographic secret key establishment mechanisms are facing challenges with the fast growth of high-performance computing, and can be very costly in many settings, e.g. in wireless ad-hoc networks, since they consume scarce resources such as bandwidth and battery power. As an alternative, link-signature-based (LSB) secret key extraction techniques have received many interests in recent years. It is believed that these mechanisms are secure, based on the fundamental assumption that wireless signals received at two locations separated by more than half a wavelength apart are uncorrelated. However, recently it has been observed that in some circumstances this assumption does not hold, rendering LSB key extraction mechanisms vulnerable to attacks. This paper studies empirical statistical inference attacks (SIA) to LSB key extraction, whereby an attacker infers the signature of a target link, and henceforce recovers the secret key extracted from that signature, by observing the surrounding links. Different from prior work that assumes a theoretical link-correlation model for the inference, our study does not make any assumption on link correlation. Instead, ours is taking a machine learning method for link inference based on empirically measured link data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are developed to launch SIA under various realistic scenarios. Our experiment results show that even without making assumptions on link correlation, the proposed inference algorithms are still quite effective, and can reduce the key search space by many orders of magnitudes compared to brutal force search.},

abstract={This work presents distributed beamforming using three dimensional randomly distributed volumetric arrays. This work examines a statistical ensemble (mean-valued) of average beampattern behavior for canonical and non-canonical volumetrically bound distributed (random) antenna arrays. Cubical, cylindrical, and spherical topologies of isotropic elements are analyzed to show beamforming and scanning from zenith to meridian for canonical topologies. In addition, small amounts of work have previously been investigated and therefore this work helps to enlighten with illustrations of the beampattern phenomena of a select few non-conically bound distributed and volumetric structures. To validate the distributed array pattern behavior, the manifold is composed of one million isotropic radiators densely populated amongst geometrical bounds to examine characteristic pattern behavior. This provides faithful convergence of numerical beampatterns to their expected (mean) patterns. Last of all, results show an increasing complexity of pattern behavior for use in many spatial advancements in distributed beamforming.},

abstract={Network intrusion detection systems are widely deployed to detect cyberattacks against computer networks. These systems generate large numbers of security alerts that require manual review by security analysts to determine the appropriate courses of action required. The review of these security alerts is time consuming and can cause fatigue for security analysts, especially during long work shifts. This paper reviews a case study of the application of machine learning to the initial triage of security alerts to help reduce the manual burden placed on Department of Defense (DOD) cyber defense security analysts. This study implemented a Federated Analysis Security Triage Tool prototype. The FASTT prototype attempted to highlight, summarize and categorize tens of thousands of daily alerts/events. The prototype integrated a number of tools including TensorFlow deep neural network classifier, Elasticsearch and Kibana to provide an alternative approach for cyber defense analysts. FASTT provides a quick way to perform security alert reviews, speed up analyst queries/response, and to semi-automate threat intelligence reporting. The results of this study were evaluated for accuracy and usability. Results demonstrated that the accuracy of a deep neural network classifier was very high, as it was able to determine the heuristics that the cyber defense security analysts used in their review. Demonstrations and interviews with the security analysts showed that the prototype was able to quickly categorize security alerts into meaningful categories, provide fast query of the alerts, and save time in generating reports. Lastly, FASTT was able to pull the necessary information to generate Indications of Compromise (IOC) in a STIX/TAXII format that could be shared across DOD and US Government.},

abstract={Despite widespread use of commercial anti-virus products, the number of malicious files detected on home and corporate computers continues to increase at a significant rate. Recently, anti-virus companies have started investing in machine learning solutions to augment signatures manually designed by analysts. A malicious file's determination is often represented as a hierarchical structure consisting of a type (e.g. Worm, Backdoor), a platform (e.g. Win32, Win64), a family (e.g. Rbot, Rugrat) and a family variant (e.g. A, B). While there has been substantial research in automated malware classification, the aforementioned hierarchical structure, which can provide additional information to the classification models, has been ignored. In this paper, we propose the novel idea and study the performance of employing hierarchical learning algorithms for automated classification of malicious files. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research effort which incorporates the hierarchical structure of the malware label in its automated classification and in the security domain, in general. It is important to note that our method does not require any additional effort by analysts because they typically assign these hierarchical labels today. Our empirical results on a real world, industrial-scale malware dataset of 3.6 million files demonstrate that incorporation of the label hierarchy achieves a significant reduction of 33.1% in the binary error rate as compared to a non-hierarchical classifier which is traditionally used in such problems.},

And a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications system model and its favorable channel propagation condition are assumed (i.e., channel independence among all channel coefficients from transmitter antenna elements to receiver antenna elements). Then, this paper derives a desirable user-specific BF expression. And the numerical results indicate that the user-specific SINRs can be achieved satisfactorily with the proposed method. However, in practice, the satellite channel may not meet the channel favorable propagation condition due to the known key hole effect. In future, it is desirable to study a BF method under a keyhole channel condition.},

The payoff is modeled as the channel capacity of the defender under white additive Gaussian noise. The defender and attacker are capable of spreading their signals over a pre-specified frequency band. Two scenarios are considered: (a) both the attacker and defender know each other's strategies, (b) the defender knows the attacker's strategy, but not vice versa. In each of these scenarios, we further consider whether the players have the knowledge about the environments. We show how to analytically determine the optimal strategies for the players in each scenario, and provide simulation results to verify our approach.},

abstract={As DoD SATCOM stakeholders and developers, it is vital to understand innovative technical trends and both leverage and influence them in order to best address our priorities. These SATCOM development priorities are growth, adoption of open commercial standards, systemic availability and simplification. Major innovative trends in SATCOM development are Digital IF, modem advances and geographical distribution of strategic RF entry points. Digital IF uses standards-based DSP innovation to enable highly advantageous SATCOM terminal system repartitioning. Modem innovations include updated protocols, interface reduction, all-digital implementations, tailoring of mod-cod sets, automated power and mod-cod responsive to traffic demand and link condition, and detailed attention to human factors. Geographic distribution of strategic RF entry points offers geographic diversity through terrestrial IF transport. All of these innovative trends enable growth in capabilities, bandwidth, link counts and systemic availability. All are based on open commercial standards which serve to simplify development, equipment, test processes, planning and operations. The challenge now is to leverage the progress of these trends optimally to help the DoD SATCOM user best support the warfighter. Optimal development along these trend lines, addressing the cited priorities, will be realized by greater awareness of these trends, rapid adoption of commercial offerings and adoption of open commercial standards along the lines of maximum commercial proliferation. On all counts, close collaboration between stakeholders is key to realizing the potential of these innovative trends.},

Detection waveforms and receiver filter are designed jointly using an algorithm that minimizes the mutual coherence of the transmit waveform and receive filter matrix product. Different from previous work, which required knowledge of the target impulse response (TIR), this paper relaxes this key assumption and studies detection of multiple extended Swerling type I targets.

pages={557-562}, 
abstract={Named Data Networking (NDN) is a clean state Internet paradigm that considers some security primitives in its original design, and one of the promising candidates for the future Internet architecture. However, it may suffer from the specific threats such as Interest Flooding Attacks (IFA). Most researches are focused on the defense against fake IFA, where the PIT resources in victim routers are exhausted by the flooding forged Interest packets requiring the non-existent contents. However, these existing mitigation mechanisms cannot defend the Collusive Interest Flooding Attacks (CIFA), which is disregarded by most related researches. In CIFA, the adversaries issue Interest packets that can be satisfied by a collusive server. In order to exhaust the PIT resources on the victim routers without being detected, the collusive server responds the received Interest packets with corresponding Data packets just before expiration of the corresponding PIT entries. In addition, the low rate intermittent characteristic of CIFA makes it difficult to be distinguished from the legitimate background traffic. Thus, the CIFA is more concealment and deception than the previous IFA. By analyzing the traffic model of CIFA, we discover that the CIFA is mostly concentrated in the low frequency bands. Based on this phenomenon, we extract the signal in attack sub-band using wavelet analysis technique and then propose our CIFA detection algorithm. We implement the CIFA model and evaluate our proposal in the ndnSIM simulator, and results confirm the feasibility and effectiveness against the CIFA.},

abstract={Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a technology for automated identification of objects and people. RFID technology is expected to find extensive use in applications related to the Internet of Things, and in particular applications of Internet of Battlefield Things. Of particular interest are passive RFID tags due to a number of their salient advantages. Such tags, lacking energy sources of their own, use backscattering of the power of an RF source (a reader) to communicate. Recently, passive RFID tag-to-tag (T2T) communication has been demonstrated, via which tags can directly communicate with each other and share information. This opens the possibility of building a Network of Tags (NeTa), in which the passive tags communicate among themselves to perform data processing functions. Among possible applications of NeTa are monitoring services in hard-to-reach locations. As an essential step toward implementation of NeTa, we consider a novel multi-hop network architecture; in particular, with the proposed novel turbo backscattering operation, inter-tag distances can be significantly increased. Due to the interference among tags' transmissions, one of the main technical challenges of implementing such the NeTa architecture is the routing protocol design. In this paper, we introduce a design of a routing protocol, which is based on a solution of a non-linear binary optimization problem. We study the performance of the proposed protocol and investigate impacts of several network factors, such as the tag density and the transmit power of the reader.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a scheme in which a communication relay unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) estimates the distribution of the terminals and selects the optimal relay position for autonomous maneuvering. In order to accomplish mission success, warfighters on the battlefield must communicate with their commander all the time. Autonomous maneuvering of a relay UAV using the proposed scheme will support their communication and mission command effectively. In the first step of the proposed scheme, the UAV estimates the distribution of the terminals using the time difference of arrival of the received signal. Once the distribution of the terminals is estimated, in the second step, the optimal relay position and altitude are determined, and the UAV maneuvers itself to relay communications. By using this scheme, there is no need to exchange specific location information, and the optimal point can be provided from the beginning of flight. In addition, this scheme has the advantage of continuous relaying at minimum power. To verify the validity and parameters of the proposed scheme, various simulations are executed and indicate the possibility of utilization in the field.},

abstract={Naval surface fleets of the United States and its allies rely on multiple satellite communication systems (SATCOM) for onboard communication with other entities such as ships, shore nodes and hosts from external networks. Current practice is for an onboard ship router to select a particular SATCOM link for each outgoing traffic flow based on a mission-specific routing policy. In this paper we propose an alternative solution by viewing the multi-SATCOM link utilization task as a traffic engineering and load balancing problem - in particular, as a Multi-Commodity Flow (MCF) optimization problem. We propose using the Flow Deviation Method (FDM) as a network-wide optimal load-balancing solution that maximizes total throughput and minimizes traffic flow delay and jitter. Our approach is equally valid for both UDP and TCP flows. Network-wide global optimization is carried out via a central controller in a Software Defined Networking (SDN) framework. For TCP flows we propose a novel solution that combines the best attributes of Multi-Path TCP, SDN and FDM. Compared to single-path TCP or MPTCP-SDN without FDM-based traffic optimizer, our proposed combined scheme is more efficient in bandwidth utilization, delay/jitter minimization and also robust against jamming and intermittent link failure. Network performance results are validated via Mininet emulation tests.},

abstract={Increased demand for wireless services has spurred research into spectrum co-existence between radar and communication systems. The effect of an unaltered radar interference on an uncoded communication receiver has been investigated for constellations used in commercial systems. However, the constellation design - possible for a cognitive transmitter-receiver pair - that maximizes the transmission rate for communication systems affected by Gaussian noise and radar interference has not yet been addressed and is tackled here. Two regimes are investigated: when the Interference-to-Noise Ratio (INR) of the radar signal is very low and very high compared to the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the communication signal. It is found that: (a) When INR≪SNR, the channel behaves as a complex-valued AWGN channel; the designed constellations exhibit a concentric (almost equilateral) hexagonal structure as the number of signal points increases, (b) When INR≫SNR≫1, the channel behaves as a real-valued phase-fading AWGN channel; the designed constellations are shaped as an (almost equally-spaced) pulse-amplitude modulation as the number of signal points increases, and (c) The designed constellations outperform practically-used ones in terms of the transmission rate.},

abstract={Empirical-based models for security technologies in the commercial and military domain, including those that focus on protection, detection, and broader risk analysis, leverage data captured from sensors on network-connected devices including gateways, routers, and host nodes. Lacking, however, are datasets that contain specific state observations and actions from the evaluator (red/blue teammer) workstation; we call this the inside-view. This is largely due to issues associated with data ownership, data classification, and the lack of integrated evaluator-centric data-collection mechanisms. To enable and promote creation of open datasets that capture the inside-view, we introduce a scalable platform that consists of two main elements. First, the emulation sandbox, or EmuBox, is an open-source and portable (i.e., it can execute on a laptop) solution for creating small-to medium-sized heterogeneous scenarios for evaluators to set up practice environments and competitions and to hone their skills. Second, the evaluatorcentric and extensible logger, ECEL, is a centralized management system that uses plugins for capturing and formatting evaluator data. We conclude the paper by providing a case study to demonstrate the setup and configuration of the platform along with a performance analysis.},

abstract={Previous work on machine learning for intrusion detection in mobile tactical networks using the extremely lightweight intrusion detection (ELIDe) system has shown that ELIDe can approximate signature-based intrusion detection using significantly less resources and power than the traditional intrusion detection system without significantly degrading accuracy. ELIDe also performs binary classification and multiclass classification on various malware that Snort cannot detect. In this paper, we demonstrate how ELIDe identifies malware within network traffic based on partially trained malware signature patterns that have significant weighted values within the classifier's weight vector. Our experiments trained ELIDe with malware signatures and network traffic without the presence of malicious traffic, and we were able to obtain the common partial patterns between the two different data sets. Based on knowledge of the common partial patterns that exist between true-negative and true-positive results from our experiments, we show that ELIDe can improve its false-positive rate without significantly affecting its false-negative rates.},

title={Nonlinear rank-based analog loop filters in delta-sigma analog-to-digital converters for mitigation of technogenic interference}, 
year={2017}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={372-381}, 
abstract={Since at any given frequency a linear filter affects both the noise and the signal of interest proportionally, when a linear filter is used to suppress the interference outside of the passband of interest the resulting signal quality is affected only by the total power and spectral composition, but not by the type of the amplitude distribution of the interfering signal. Thus a linear filter cannot improve the passband signal-to-noise ratio, regardless of the type of noise. On the other hand, a nonlinear filter has the ability to disproportionately affect signals with different temporal and/or amplitude structures, and it may reduce the spectral density of non-Gaussian interferences in the signal passband without significantly affecting the signal of interest. As a result, the signal quality can be improved in excess of that achievable by a linear filter. Such non-Gaussian (and, in particular, impulsive) noise can originate from a multitude of natural and technogenic (man-made) phenomena. The technogenic noise specifically is a ubiquitous and growing source of harmful interference affecting communication and data acquisition systems, and such noise may dominate over the thermal noise. While the non-Gaussian nature of technogenic noise provides an opportunity for its effective mitigation by nonlinear filtering, current state-of-the-art approaches employ such filtering in the digital domain, after analog-to-digital conversion. In the process of such conversion, the signal bandwidth is reduced, which substantially diminishes the effectiveness of the subsequent noise removal techniques. In this paper, we focus on impulsive noise mitigation, and propose to incorporate impulsive noise filtering of the analog input signal into loop filters of ΔΣ analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Such ADCs thus combine analog-to-digital conversion with analog nonlinear rank filtering, enabling mitigation of various types of in-band non-Gaussian noise- and interference, including broadband impulsive interference. An important property of the presented approach is that, while being nonlinear in general, the proposed ADCs largely behave linearly. They exhibit nonlinear behavior only intermittently, in response to noise outliers, thus avoiding the detrimental effects, such as instabilities and intermodulation distortions, often associated with nonlinear signal processing.},

abstract={This paper analyzes the outage probability of a multicarrier signal, using the Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW) on the return link (RL). The signal is relayed over a nonlinear distorted satellite transponder. The transponder is modelled to include a gain element, a soft limiter, and a travelling wave tube amplifier (TWTA); a Shaleh model is used to model the TWTA. The outage probability is determined when the probability of the mutual information random variable is less than the code rate. The outage probability is used as a theoretical bound for maximum capacity. This bound serves as an important benchmark of the achievable rate for the RL. The degree in which M-ary phased shift keying (MPSK) signals using Digital Video Broadcasting - Satellite - Second generation (DVB-S2) forward error correction (FEC) with numerous code rates to achieve this bound is investigated by computer simulation, and also discussed in the paper.},

abstract={As cloud services become mature and provide capabilities for elastic computation and data management, hosting services become increasingly prevalent such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or RedHat OpenStack. Workloads are hosted in these platforms using hypervisors running on physical machines which host virtual machines (VMs) presented to the customer. Software-defined network (SDN) technologies move many of the network functions into the hosts. Accordingly SDN-based VM placements have received significant attention as a way to minimize network traffic between VMs and hosts. Careful placement of VMs can generate a significantly lower amount of network traffic to the hosting provider. Further, it may impact the level of security risk exposed by the VM placement as each VM may have a different level of security risk. In this work, we consider these two conflicting goals by presenting a Software-Defined Network based VM Placement, called SDNVMP, to minimize both network traffic between VMs (and hosts) and security risk by grouping VMs with similar security scrutiny needs. Our results show that the proposed placement algorithm outperforms the baseline counterparts in terms of network traffic overhead and security risk in each VM introduced by such algorithms.},

abstract={Personnel operating in tactical environments heavily rely on information sharing to perform their missions. Solutions deployed in these environments need to focus on reliability and performance, in addition to usability to work as unattended as possible due to the often chaotic nature of operations. In this paper we propose a solution for delay-tolerant data sharing, in particular file sharing, using well supported, common networking protocols. The solution is based on the concept of broadcatching, which combines a delay-tolerant protocol such as BitTorrent with a publish/subscribe mechanism such as RSS to enable “many to one” information sharing. Experimental data shows that it is a promising approach for enabling reliable, mostly unattended data sharing on tactical networks in tactical environments.},

In this analysis, we control the codeword's transmission parameters by achieving a good trade-off between setting more resources with changing the modulation order, hence reducing the relay's access link transmitted power. We first address the calculations of codeword's size in 3GPP specification, where an unhealthy component carrier selection mechanism is introduced for defining relay's transmission spectrum. Then, we present a novel 3GPP-compliant binary integer optimization model subject to several practical constraints, such as the requisite resources and throughput. Through system level simulations, the proposed approach is compared with the conventional relaying systems. It is shown that our approach has made several improvements to the conventional schemes.},

abstract={In a communication-constrained and adversarial environment, it is an interesting and challenging problem for multiple vehicles to patrol the whole environment by sensing with their limited visibility. Early works based on deterministic paths are predictable to the adversary, and recent non-deterministic works are limited to only a circular environment and require synchronization. So, we propose a method of finding patrolling policies for multiple vehicles that monitor any polygonal environment using limited visibility regions and non-deterministic patrolling paths. First, limited visibility regions are calculated for a subset of locations that cover the whole environment or a part of the environment. Then, we find distributed patrolling policies in the form of Markov chains, using convex optimization to minimize the average expected commute time for the subset of the locations permitting each vehicle to cover the whole environment independently. We also find coordinated and Markov chain based patrolling policies that minimize the average commute time for the subset of locations permitting each vehicle to cover a part of the environment and additionally, communicate with a centralized base station. We present multiple simulation results to show the effectiveness of our visibility-based non-deterministic patrolling method.},

abstract={Energy harvesting motivated networks (EHNets) are rapidly emerging as a major part of ubiquitous computing and communication infrastructure in the presence of Internet-of-Things (IoT). A set of self-sustainable nodes equipped with energy harvesting capabilities can effectively exploit ambient energy and convert it into electric energy, but it is admittedly vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack that primarily targets service availability, often witnessed in wireless multi-hop networks. In this paper, we propose an adaptive acknowledgment-based approach, called AAA, to detect the stealthy collision attack caused by multiple malicious nodes in the realm of EHNets, where two malicious nodes coordinate their packet transmissions simultaneously to create the packet collision at a legitimate node. In the AAA, each node forwards a Data packet, monitors the subsequent packet transmission of its one-hop downstream node and waits for an explicit acknowledgment (Ack) packet from its two-hop downstream node, and then detects the stealthy collision attack in EHNets. We conduct extensive simulation experiments using OMNeT++ for performance evaluation and comparison. The simulation results indicate that the proposed countermeasure can provide higher detection rate and packet delivery ratio but lower detection latency compared to the existing scheme, MCC.},

abstract={The edge computing techniques have been developed to support the exponentially increasing service demands in the fifth generation (5G) networks by bringing the data contents and their corresponding computations/communications near to mobile users. As a promising and efficient solution to implement edge computing techniques, mobile data offloading complements the traditional cellular transmission through either WiFi networks or device-to-device (D2D) communication/relay to mitigate the overloaded wireless traffics for cellular networks. However, the mobile data offloading in edge computing wireless networks imposes many new quality of service (QoS) guarantee problems which still remain opening research areas. To overcome these challenges, in this paper we propose the statistical delay-bounded QoS provisioning schemes using the effective capacity theory for two types of mobile data offloading: WiFi offloading and D2D offloading, where we formulate the WiFi offloading and D2D offloading as the single-hop and two-hop wireless-link statistical QoS provisioning problems, respectively. We also derive the optimal probability of using each type of offloading which maximizes the average effective capacity for all mobile users under the following two scenarios: (1) all mobile users have the same probability of requesting the popular multimedia data contents and have the same probability to become a relay in D2D offloading; and (2) each mobile user has the distinct probability of requesting the popular multimedia data contents and the distinct probability to become a relay in D2D offloading. Finally, we evaluate and validate our proposed statistical delay-bounded QoS provisioning schemes over multimedia data offloading architecture through numerical analyses.},

abstract={Citizen Broadband Radio Service band (3550-3700 GHz) is seen as one of the key frequency bands to enable improvements in the performance of wireless broadband and cellular systems. A careful study of interference caused by a secondary cellular communication system coexisting with an incumbent naval radar is required to establish a pragmatic protection distance, which not only protects the incumbent from harmful interference but also can increase spectrum access opportunity for the coexisting secondary system. In this context, this paper investigates the co-channel and adjacent channel coexistence of a ship-borne naval radar with a wide-area cellular communication system and presents the analysis of interference caused by downlink transmissions of the cellular system on the naval radar for different values of radar protection distance. The results of such analysis suggest that maintaining a protection distance of 30 km from the radar will ensure the required INR protection criterion of -6 dB at the radar receiver with > 0.9 probability, even when the secondary network operates on the same channel as the radar. Novel power control algorithms to assign operating powers to the coexisting cellular devices are also proposed to further reduce the protection distance from radar while still meeting the radar INR protection requirement.},

abstract={Sophisticated cyber attacks by state-sponsored and criminal actors continue to plague government and industrial infrastructure. Intuitively, partitioning cyber systems into survivable, intrusion tolerant compartments is a good idea. This prevents witting and unwitting insiders from moving laterally and reaching back to their command and control (C2) servers. However, there is a lack of artifacts that can predict the effectiveness of this approach in a realistic setting. We extend earlier work by relaxing simplifying assumptions and providing a new attacker-facing metric. In this article, we propose new closed-form mathematical models and a discrete time simulation to predict three critical statistics: probability of compromise, probability of external host compromise and probability of reachback. The results of our new artifacts agree with one another and with previous work, which suggests they are internally valid and a viable method to evaluate the effectiveness of cyber zone defense.},

abstract={In a wireless ad hoc multimedia network, how does the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the user affect the level of Situational Awareness (SA)? Is maximum QoE necessary for high SA? In this empirical study, we propose a novel measurement approach to quantify SA based on the QoE of the user. The relationship between QoE and network Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as delay and packet loss is well known. Therefore, quantifying the SA-QoE-QoS relationship will help the network operator to ensure a high level of SA when the network is under attack, through parsimonious allocation of network resources such as spectrum and power. We first define SA metrics in four contexts: Surroundings awareness, Target awareness, Location awareness, and Responsiveness (SETLR model). Next, we design an experiment and define an objective expression for each SETLR metric. We mathematically formulate SA as a function of QoE, using real data, and show that this relationship is logistic in nature. This new utility function for measuring SA can now be used in network optimization techniques to avoid over-provisioning. Finally, we observe that maximum QoE is in fact not necessary to ensure high SA; a Mean Opinion Score of just 2-3 is necessary in our scenario.},

pages={611-616}, 
abstract={Future tactical communications involves high data rate best effort traffic working alongside real-time traffic for time-critical applications with hard deadlines. Unavailable bandwidth and/or untimely responses may lead to undesired or even catastrophic outcomes. Ethernet-based communication systems are one of the major tactical network standards due to the higher bandwidth, better utilization, and ability to handle heterogeneous traffic. However, Ethernet suffers from inconsistent performance for jitter, latency and bandwidth under heavy loads. The emerging Time-Triggered Ethernet (TTE) solutions promise deterministic Ethernet performance, fault-tolerant topologies and real-time guarantees for critical traffic. In this paper we study the TTE protocol and build a TTTech TTE test bed to evaluate its performance. Through experimental study, the TTE protocol was observed to provide consistent high data rates for best effort messages, determinism with very low jitter for time-triggered messages, and fault-tolerance for minimal packet loss using redundant networking topologies. In addition, challenges were observed that presented a trade-off between the integration cycle and the synchronization overhead. It is concluded that TTE is a capable solution to support heterogeneous traffic in time-critical applications, such as aerospace systems (eg. airplanes, spacecraft, etc.), ground-based vehicles (eg. trains, buses, cars, etc), and cyber-physical systems (eg. smart-grids, IoT, etc.).},

abstract={This paper provides a methodology to study the PHY layer vulnerability of wireless protocols in hostile radio environments. Our approach is based on testing the vulnerabilities of a system by analyzing the individual subsystems. By targeting an individual subsystem or a combination of subsystems at a time, we can infer the weakest part and revise it to improve the overall system performance. We apply our methodology to 4G LTE downlink by considering each control channel as a subsystem. We also develop open-source software enabling research and education using software-defined radios. We present experimental results with open-source LTE systems and shows how the different subsystems behave under targeted interference. The analysis for the LTE downlink shows that the synchronization signals (PSS/SSS) are very resilient to interference, whereas the downlink pilots or Cell-Specific Reference signals (CRS) are the most susceptible to a synchronized protocol-aware interferer. We also analyze the severity of control channel attacks for different LTE configurations. Our methodology and tools allow rapid evaluation of the PHY layer reliability in harsh signaling environments, which is an asset to improve current standards and develop new and robust wireless protocols.},

abstract={Content-Centric Networking (CCN) proposals rethink the communication model around named data. In-network caching is a fundamental feature to distinguish the CCN from the current host-centric IP network. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid caching scheme which combines the on-path one and the off-path one. We leverage the ISOMAP manifold learning algorithm to distinguish the importance of nodes. The important nodes apply LCE (Leave Copy Everywhere). So the future requests for popular content can be quickly satisfied by duplicate caching. The unimportant nodes apply a hash-routing-based cache strategy to cache the unpopular contents in order to increase the cache diversity. The proposed hybrid cache coordination scheme can balance between the user's QoE and resource utilization. Extensive experiments have been performed to evaluate the proposed scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed is effective and outperforms the existing caching mechanisms in CCN.},

abstract={We investigate adaptive transmission for tactical packet radio networks in which a source uses fountain coding to multicast a file to a number of destinations over time-varying links. We examine two strategies from the literature for packet-by-packet adaptation of the modulation and channel code. The maximum data-recovery rate philosophy attempts to maximize the throughput for each transmitted packet. It can employ control information derived from practical receiver statistics. The weighted completion time approach minimizes a function of the expected file-delivery delays at the destinations and uses control information derived from perfect channel-state information and knowledge of the number of packets received by each destination. We devise a minimax completion time protocol that uses the same control information as the weighted completion time approach but applies the minimax criterion to the expected delays to select transmission parameters for each packet. Performance comparisons are given for a number of different multicast networks in which each link experiences correlated Rayleigh fading.},

The quality of synthesis is measured by total variation distance between the synthesized and desired statistics. The proposed layered and successive encoding scheme relies on the learned structure of tree to use minimal number of common random variables to synthesize the desired density. We characterize the achievable rate region for the rate tuples of multi-layer latent Gaussian tree, through which the number of bits needed to simulate such Gaussian joint density are determined. The random sources used in our algorithm are the latent variables at the top layer of tree, the additive independent Gaussian noises, and the Bernoulli sign inputs that capture the ambiguity of correlation signs between the variables.},

In this paper, we investigate PCL systems to estimate an unknown target position in three dimensional space, and propose a target-tracking process of three steps: 1) receiver selection, 2) target-tracking algorithm, and 3) filtering process. To reduce an estimation error of target position, especially Z coordinate of the target position, we also propose a receiver selection algorithm. The selected receivers can be utilized in the proposed target-tracking algorithm that successively estimates target positions in XY and YZ planes. Furthermore, in YZ plane, an estimation error of Z coordinate can be minimized by allocating different weights on each receiver's estimate. Lastly, a decoupled Kalman filter is applied to the target-tracking process. Simulation results show that the proposed target-tracking process achieves higher accuracy than other algorithms.},

abstract={The large number of malicious files that are produced daily outpaces the current capacity of malware analysis and detection. For example, Intel Security Labs reported that during the second quarter of 2016, their system found more than 40M of new malware [1]. The damage of malware attacks is also increasingly devastating, as witnessed by the recent Cryptowall malware that has reportedly generated more than $325M in ransom payments to its perpetrators [2]. In terms of defense, it has been widely accepted that the traditional approach based on byte-string signatures is increasingly ineffective, especially for new malware samples and sophisticated variants of existing ones. New techniques are therefore needed for effective defense against malware. Motivated by this problem, the paper investigates a new defense technique against malware. The technique presented in this paper is utilized for automatic identification of malware packers that are used to obfuscate malware programs. Signatures of malware packers and obfuscators are extracted from the CFGs of malware samples. Unlike conventional byte signatures that can be evaded by simply modifying one or multiple bytes in malware samples, these signatures are more difficult to evade. For example, CFG-based signatures are shown to be resilient against instruction modifications and shuffling, as a single signature is sufficient for detecting mildly different versions of the same malware. Last but not least, the process for extracting CFG-based signatures is also made automatic.},

We investigated two methods: one using the spatial difference between multiple GPS units at the vertices of a polygon, and the other using the differences over time measured using a single GPS unit. We tested the antenna orientation system with the Omnispace F2 satellite at the US Electrodynamics, Inc. (USEI) teleport in Brewster, WA. Although non-correlated systematic errors in the GPS receivers made the multiple-GPS system impractical, the time-differential method was able to maintain a satellite lock for the majority of a simple test course.

pages={331-336}, 
abstract={With growing need for satellite based communication systems, there is increasing focus on the technological advancements that can reduce the cost and SWaP (Size, Weight, and Power) of a satellite payload without compromising the achieved bandwidth efficiency. In a recent technological development, the signal processing for payload antenna beamforming is moved to the ground. The resultant scheme, called Ground-Based Beam Forming or GBBF (i) provides for a significant simplification to the satellite payload design, (ii) allows for improved system performance, and (iii) results in better system flexibility. A critical requirement in the GBBF system is a real-time calibration of payload antenna array. In one scheme for GBBF calibration, several transceiver systems, called Calibration Earth Stations or CESs, are placed at strategic locations within the satellite antenna coverage. CES location determination is an important system design problem for GBBF system development, as an improper choice of locations of CESs can either result in more number of CESs than necessary (thereby increasing the system cost and the CES site maintenance concerns) and/or it can deteriorate the performance of GBBF calibration. This paper describes a solution to this problem. Two criteria that the chosen CES locations should attain are described. Determination of the requisite number of CESs and their locations is cast as a problem of multi-dimensional nonlinear optimization of the selected criteria. A solution based on the stochastic annealing method is developed and its results are presented. This approach has been successfully applied in the GBBF system development for a European GEO satellite system.},

This has led to a situation whereby users are able to verify the identity of an organization or e-commerce retailer via their digital certificate, but organizations have to rely on weak username and password combinations to verify the identity of customers registered with their service. We propose the X509Cloud framework which enables organizations to issue certificates to their users at zero cost, and allows them to securely store and disseminate client certificates using the Bitcoin inspired blockchain protocol. This in turn will enable organizations and individuals to authenticate and to securely communicate with other users on the Internet.},

abstract={Although an external Global Navigational Satellite System (GNSS) solution is often relied upon for fixing the location of user terminals (UTs), fixing the UT position autonomously in LEO satellite systems is a tractable problem which has a system benefit. An autonomous solution comes to use if the GNSS solution becomes unavailable either temporarily (e.g., due to a delay in initial GNSS position fix) or for prolonged periods (due to major outages or regulatory constraints), or if the system security policies do not allow transmission of the user position over the air. In this paper, we describe two nonlinear root-finding algorithms (applicable either at the UT or at the satellite Gateway (GW)) that take as the inputs the delay and Doppler offset measurements from the physical layer receiver and generate an estimate of the user location (and optionally velocity) as the output. Algorithm simulation results suggest that a high accuracy estimate (in which position error exceeds 1 km in less than 10% cases) is possible when UT has visibility to more than one satellite, while less accurate results (e.g., ~ 20% chance of position errors exceeding 2 km) are achievable in a single satellite scenario.},

abstract={Electromagnetic interference can cause severe performance degradation on wireless communication systems. In modern military platforms there are many closely located electronic systems, which could potentially cause interference. The performance degradation is largely affected by the characteristics of the interference. With knowledge of the actual interference environment, radio receivers can be adapted to interference characteristics, and thereby providing greatly improved performance. In this work we propose a method for online classification of the interference while receiving an unknown communication signal. Thus, there is no need to interrupt the communication for sensing the environment. The proposed method is evaluated with Monte Carlo simulations, and shown to perform well. Simulations show that the proposed online classification method perform close to the offline optimal classifier at low and high SNR, and just slightly worse at medium SNR (close to 0 dB). The proposed classification method can be used in many applications, such as adaptive demodulation and error correction, dynamic frequency selection and power allocation, and detection and identification of different kinds of interference sources or jamming equipment.},

pages={846-851}, 
abstract={There are two broad safety related message categories in vehicular networks: emergency and periodic messages that should share the scarce wireless resource simultaneously. Emergency messages deliver time-critical information with guaranteed reliability, e.g., road-safety information, whereas periodic ones convey normal status update information, e.g., vehicular positions, that is less time- and loss-critical. Recent studies on efficient Medium Access Controls (MACs) under these requirements propose to use the IEEE 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) protocol with a strict priority. In this paper, we first model this protocol by a coupled embedded markov chain, and consider an optimization problem that requires to jointly characterize delivery probability and delay of those two types of messages. Our characterization of delivery probability and delay using the modeled embedded Markov chain enables one to easily find the right protocol parameters that satisfy given requirements of emergent and periodic messages, providing a useful engineering value in running the MAC protocol over vehicular networks. We conduct extensive simulations to validate our analytical findings, which we believe is of broad interest to an environment consisting of emergent and periodic message transmissions such as tactical networks with drones.},

pages={79-84}, 
abstract={Traffic in military ad hoc networks are often broadcast or multicast traffic. A robust and efficient way to handle this type of traffic is the multi-point-relay (MPR) method. Furthermore, frequency spectrum is a scarce resource and must often be shared by several networks resulting in a risk for internetwork interference. The objective of this paper is to analyze the effects from internetwork interference in frequency-hopping (FH) ad hoc networks. Earlier work show that performance on a communication link can be degraded by interference between FH systems sharing the same spectrum resource. Results in this paper show that ad hoc networks are robust against FH interference in terms of a maintained high delivery ratio, but it is achieved at the cost of reduced capacity in the network. This reduction can in some scenarios be severe resulting in two networks with interference being less efficient than time-sharing between the networks.},

In this paper, we propose a DNS query-based DDoS attack mitigation system using Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to block the network traffic for DDoS attacks. With some features provided by SDN, we can analyze traffic patterns and filter suspicious network flows out. To show the feasibility of the proposed system, we particularly implemented a prototype with Dirichlet process mixture model to distinguish benign traffic from malicious traffic and conducted experiments with the dataset collected from real network traces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by both simulations and experiment data obtained from the real network traffic traces.},

abstract={Conventional correlation-based frame synchronization techniques can suffer significant performance degradation over multi-path frequency-selective channels. As a remedy, in this paper we consider joint frame synchronization and channel estimation. This, however, increases the length of the resulting combined channel and its estimation becomes more challenging. On the other hand, since the combined channel is a sparse vector, sparse channel estimation methods can be applied. We propose a joint frame synchronization and channel estimation method using the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm which exploits the sparsity of the combined channel vector. Subsequently, the channel estimate is used to design the equalizer. Our simulation results and experimental outcomes using software defined radios show that the proposed approach improves the overall system performance in terms of the mean square error (MSE) between the transmitted and the equalized symbols compared to the conventional method.},

abstract={Mobile tactical networks (MTNs) in military communications extend the capabilities of mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs). The MTNs are dynamic, infrastructureless, self-forming and self-healing systems designed for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) operations using multi-hop relaying. Unlike their commercial counterparts, MTNs have to offer much higher levels of security, jamming resistance, and service robustness in the adverse propagation environments without sacrificing or limiting data rate, latency, and node mobility while also controlling the network capital and operational costs. Comprehensive comparison of the performance and design characteristics of the commercial MANETs and their military counterparts is carried out using NS2 simulations. It is found that, for scenarios requiring long-range connectivity, a reference point group mobility (RPGM) model and a two-way ground radio propagation model give the most accurate performance predictions for MTNs. Finally, it is argued that many commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies can be adopted for their use in MTNs, even though it requires a lot of additional efforts to overcome challenges not considered by the commercial solutions.},

abstract={In this paper we consider the broadband-narrowband coexistence scenario where the unused spectral gaps in the professional mobile radio (PMR) frequency band are used for broadband data communications. Spectrally confined filter bank based multicarrier (FBMC) waveform is applied for broadband transmission in order to minimize the interference leakage between the new broadband system and the legacy narrowband system. Fast convolution filter banks (FC-FBs) are used for flexible waveform processing both on the transmitter and the receiver sides. Furthermore, subband energy detection based methods utilizing FC-FBs are proposed for robust spectrum sensing of the legacy PMR signals of the terrestrial trunked radio (TETRA) family. The main idea in this study is to observe the spectral variability due to primary transmissions by dividing the sensing frequency band into relatively narrow subbands and then comparing the subband energies. The flexibility of FC-FB makes it possible to optimize the broadband waveform processing and spectrum sensing filter characteristics independently. Our proposed maximum and minimum subband energy based approach shows improved robustness to the uncertainty of noise, considering also the interference due to power leakage effects.},

abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) such as Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) sense and actuate their environment in pursuit of a mission. The attack surface of these remotely located, sensing and communicating devices is both large, and exposed to adversarial actors, making mission assurance a challenging problem. While best-practice security policies should be followed, they are rarely enough to guarantee mission success as not all components in the system may be trusted and the properties of the environment (e.g., the RF environment) may be under the control of the attacker. CPS must thus be built with a high degree of resilience to mitigate threats that security cannot alleviate. In this paper, we describe the Agile and Resilient Embedded Systems (ARES) methodology and metric set. The ARES methodology pursues cyber security and resilience (CSR) as high level system properties to be developed in the context of the mission. An analytic process guides system developers in defining mission objectives, examining principal issues, applying CSR technologies, and understanding their interactions.},

year={2017}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={243-248}, 
abstract={This paper presents a novel approach to launch and defend against the causative and evasion attacks on machine learning classifiers. As the preliminary step, the adversary starts with an exploratory attack based on deep learning (DL) and builds a functionally equivalent classifier by polling the online target classifier with input data and observing the returned labels. Using this inferred classifier, the adversary can select samples according to their DL scores and feed them to the original classifier. In an evasion attack, the adversary feeds the target classifier with test data after selecting samples with DL scores that are close to the decision boundary to increase the chance that these samples are misclassified. In a causative attack, the adversary feeds the target classifier with training data after changing the labels of samples with DL scores that are far away from the decision boundary to reduce the reliability of the training process. Results obtained for text and image classification show that the proposed evasion and causative attacks can significantly increase the error during test and training phases, respectively. A defense strategy is presented to change a small number of labels of the original classifier to prevent its reliable inference by the adversary and its effective use in evasion and causative attacks. These findings identify new vulnerabilities of machine learning and demonstrate that a proactive defense mechanism can reduce the impact of the underlying attacks.},

abstract={This paper describes a new implementation of the Elastic Multicast (EM) protocol including new design enhancements for improved dynamic operation. The paper also presents additional performance data collected from emulation-based mobile network experiments. EM is a low complexity extension to Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF) that adds group-specific dynamic pruning of the SMF-based multicast forwarding mesh for higher rate traffic flows. It therefore reduces overhead by pruning the SMF relay sets in areas where no receivers exist. Our experimental emulation results show that, under a variety of mobility conditions and multicast group distribution patterns, EM maintains SMF-like data delivery robustness while significantly reducing overhead. We also demonstrate that a new design feature that provides preemptive ACK messages for active receiver groups leads to lower loss under mobility and sparse receiver groups. Based upon the results, we consider this feature critical to be included in any future EM design. We also present experimental results examining the performance of EM with classical flooding (CF) and connected dominating set (CDS) relay modes. We show, for the experiments examined, that CF provides some reduced loss with minimal additional overhead when used with EM. We also discuss future work and ongoing issues.},

abstract={This work studies centrality metrics as forwarding load predictors, for both unicast and multicast traffic, within dynamic ad hoc network topologies. We present results from a series of emulation experiments based around an emergency response mobile network scenario. From collected temporal topological and traffic data, we calculate a rank correlation measure between predictive centrality metrics and actual observed traffic forwarding by nodes using several mobile topologies. We include the examination of a localized bridging centrality metric, previously developed, along with several well-known centrality measures. We show that under static conditions, all predictive metrics are extremely accurate; whereas under different motion conditions, there are reduced levels of accuracy. Yet, even during mobility cases, the ranking correlation between measured forwarding and the predictive metrics stays moderately positive throughout the experiments. We demonstrate stronger overall correlation in the unicast traffic flow cases and our localized bridging centrality tracks well in accuracy with other global state centrality metric variations. As expected, multicast forwarding scenarios are more challenging and show somewhat lower correlation in overall ranking prediction. Perhaps surprisingly, localized bridging centrality frequently outperforms other centrality metrics in mixed mobility cases for the multicast routing flows examined. Much of this work is preliminary and we discuss ongoing challenges, potential applications, and further planned work. Early results regarding the use of localized bridging centrality as a predictive measure for traffic forwarding are encouraging.},

abstract={This paper studies the problem of routing in a multilayer (communication and social) network. Network protocols, such as link state routing and its variants, heavily used in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) cannot sustain robustness and efficiency as the topological information becomes easily stale with fast network dynamics. Attempts to collect and exchange excessive network information would result in significant overhead and would degrade the overall network performance. This paper presents the SCATE (Social-Cognitive Advancement at Tactical Edge) routing protocol that applies social-cognitive techniques to improve robustness and efficiency of a multilayer network with MANET communication and social links. In a distributed and decentralized setting with local information, nodes learn and update their distances to destinations using social-cognitive metrics and make routing decisions to minimize the end-to-end delay. The SCATE protocol is compared with Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) with and without social links. Stand-alone computer simulations and high fidelity simulation/emulation tests with CORE and EMANE are used to evaluate SCATE under different communication network (traffic and mobility) and social network effects. Results show that the SCATE protocol is a viable solution to MANET routing by substantially reducing the overhead and the end-to-end delay, and increasing the end-to-end delivery ratio for both unicast and multicast traffic.},

abstract={Covert/side channel attacks based on electromagnetic (EM) emanations are difficult to detect because they are practiced wirelessly. Hence, quantifying information leakage is crucial when designing secure hardware and software. To address this problem, this paper establishes a connection between the signal energy available to an attacker in electromagnetic side/covert channel and capacity of the covert/side channel. We first present a mathematical relationship between electromagnetic side-channel energy (ESE) of individual instructions and measured side-channel signal power, assuming that all instructions have equal execution time. Then, we use this measure to calculate the transition probabilities needed for estimating capacity. Furthermore, we consider each instruction as a codeword and relate our model to Shannon's capacity. Finally, we provide practical examples to demonstrate the severity of covert/side channel due to EM emanations.},

A central controller realizes the automatic network configuration in SDN at run time by conforming to a control plane protocol (e.g., OpenFlow) and switches act as simple forwarding devices. However, SDN are susceptible to cyber attacks and there is a need to understand and quantify the cyber risks. In this paper, we present a model to analyze attacks on SDN and generate risk assessment scores that can aid mitigation. We build and analyze a Generalized Stochastic Petri Net (GSPN) model for Denial of Service attack in SDN using the PIPE tool. The results show all possible attacker paths during the attack. Moreover, they indicate that there is a direct relation between the risk score of the transitions and the average time the attacker needs to successfully perform individual attack action.

Emphasis is on managing cross-domain roaming, where challenges include terminal mobility, waveform switching, adaptive modulation/coding, antenna beam handover, terminal reconfiguration, service transfer, along with associated management and control of multiple service providers in realtime. Policy planning and enforcement coordination between subsidiary network managers and element managers is discussed.},

abstract={As the rate at which digital data is generated continues to grow, so does the need to ensure that data can be stored securely. The use of an NSA-certified Inline Media Encryptor (IME) is often required to protect classified data, as its security properties can be fully analyzed and certified with minimal coupling to the environment in which it is embedded. However, these devices are historically purpose-built and must often be redesigned and recertified for each target system. This tedious and costly (but necessary) process limits the ability for an information system architect to leverage advances made in storage technology. Our universal Classified Data At Rest (CDAR) architecture represents a modular approach to reduce this burden and maximize interface flexibility. The core module is designed around NVMe, a high-performance storage interface built directly on PCIe. Interfacing with non-NVMe interfaces such as SATA is achieved with adapters which are outside the certification boundary and therefore can be less costly and leverage rapidly evolving commercial technology. This work includes an analysis for both the functionality and security of this architecture. A prototype was developed with peak throughput of 23.9 Gb/s at a power consumption of 8.5W, making it suitable for a wide range of storage applications.},

Using a novel 28 GHz phased-array sounder with high phase stability, we present results in an urban microcell LoS, and LOS to NLOS transition region scenario, for the stationarity region of shadowing, power delay profile, and the angular power spectrum.

pages={678-682}, 
abstract={Anomaly detection is the process of identifying unusual signals in a set of observations. This is a vital task in a variety of fields including cybersecurity and the battlefield. In many scenarios, observations are gathered from a set of distributed mobile or small form factor devices. Traditionally, the observations are sent to centralized servers where large-scale systems perform analytics on the data gathered from all devices. However, the compute capability of these small form factor devices is ever increasing with annual improvements to hardware. A new model, known as edge computing, takes advantage of this compute capability and performs local analytics on the distributed devices. This paper presents an approach to anomaly detection that uses autoencoders, specialized deep learning neural networks, deployed on each edge device, to perform analytics and identify anomalous observations in a distributed fashion. Simultaneously, the autoencoders learn from the new observations in order to identify new trends. A centralized server aggregates the updated models and distributes them back to the edge devices when a connection is available. This architecture reduces the bandwidth and connectivity requirements between the edge devices and the central server as only the autoencoder model and anomalous observations must be sent to the central servers, rather than all observation data.},

volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={858-863}, 
abstract={This paper presents the joint design of network coding and backpressure algorithm for cognitive radio networks and its implementation with software-defined radios (SDRs) in a high fidelity network emulation testbed. The backpressure algorithm is known to provide throughput optimal solutions to joint routing and scheduling for dynamic packet traffic. This solution applies to cognitive radio networks with spectrum dynamics changing over time and space, and supports joint routing and spectrum access without any need for end-to-end path maintenance. The backpressure algorithm is extended to multicast traffic with network coding deployed over virtual queues that represent different flows per session and destination. This extension is supported with different methods to decode packets at destinations. In the absence of a common control channel, distributed coordination with local information exchange is used to support neighborhood discovery, spectrum sensing and channel estimation that are integrated with joint routing, channel access and network coding. Cognitive network functionalities are implemented with GNU Radio and Python modules for different network layers, and used with USRP N210 radios. Practical radio implementation issues are addressed in a distributed wireless network setting, where USRP N210 radios communicate with each other through RFnest, a high fidelity wireless network emulation tool. RFnest provides realistic physical channel environment by digitally controlling path loss, fading, delay, topology and mobility effects. Extensive emulation test results are provided to assess throughput, backlog and energy consumption and verify the SDR implementation of joint network coding and backpressure algorithm under realistic channel and radio hardware effects.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose and analyze new spectrum-efficient communication and radar sensing systems (named ComSens) operating in full-duplex mode with frequency division duplex scheme. ComSens simultaneously use the pilot overhead for channel estimation and radar sensing. The performances of ComSens are analyzed in terms of ergodic communication data-rate and radar estimation rate. The total system rate is optimized with respect to the pilot overhead size and the pilot powers. The numerical results show that the optimization of the pilot overhead is critical for ComSens. The radar-estimation rate increases with pilot size, pilot power, and self-interference cancellation level. With an average self-interference cancellation of 110 dB, our radar-estimation rate values are similar to the radar-estimation rate values derived for a stand-alone radar system.},

abstract={In this paper, we model a Stackelberg game in a simple Gaussian test channel where a human transmitter (leader) communicates a source message to a human receiver (follower). We model human decision making using prospect theory models proposed for continuous decision spaces. Assuming that the value function is the squared distortion at both the transmitter and the receiver, we analyze the effects of the weight functions at both the transmitter and the receiver on optimal communication strategies, namely encoding at the transmitter and decoding at the receiver, in the Stackelberg sense. We show that the optimal strategies for the behavioral agents in the Stackelberg sense are identical to those designed for unbiased agents. At the same time, we also show that the prospect-theoretic distortions at both the transmitter and the receiver are both larger than the expected distortion, thus making behavioral agents less contended than unbiased agents. Consequently, the presence of cognitive biases increases the need for transmission power in order to achieve a given distortion at both transmitter and receiver.},

abstract={In this work, we implement and demonstrate differential amplify-and-forward (DAF) cooperative relaying as a novel diversity technique to combat bit errors and outages common in airborne environments. By using differential modulation and demodulation, we reduce the system complexity by avoiding channel estimation which is often unreliable or computationally costly in dynamic environments with mobile nodes. We further simplify the requirements of the relay node by employing amplify-and-forward relaying where the relay amplifies the incoming signal and retransmits at a different frequency assignment. We implemented DAF relaying using the GNU Radio software platform and Universal Software Radio Peripherals (USRPs). We designed a pilot sequence specifically for differential modulation and implemented frame level synchronization which can combine frames properly at the destination node for joint decoding even when some frames are dropped either from the direct link or relay link. We verified simulation results of DAF relaying in a controlled test in an anechoic chamber and showed that cooperative relaying achieves significantly lower bit error rate compared to direct link transmission and two-hop relaying schemes. We then validated our system outdoors with an airborne relay node and demonstrated our results.},

abstract={This paper explores several algorithms that sequentially select input values to probe a discrete memoryless binary output channel (DMBOC) and establish a communication rate close to the capacity C. Adapting techniques from pure-exploration multi-arm bandit problems, each algorithm strives to sample an unknown channel as few times as possible to maximize a lower-bound rate RL that: (1) holds with at least a specified probability and (2) is within a specified fraction of C. To assess performance, we first determine the minimum number of input samples O(N) required to prove a known DMBOC supports rate RL with high probability and then show (through empirical evidence) that an algorithm can `learn' the channel and achieve the same lower-bound rate using O (N log (N)) sequential channel probes. However, by changing the selection strategy to reduce the number of input selection decisions, empirical results show that sample complexity is further reduced to only O (N log (log (N))) sequential channel probes.},

abstract={Wireless power transfer may enable remotely powered operation of low-energy devices. The use of directional antenna arrays makes millimeter wave (mmWave) band a potential candidate for wireless power transfer. The mmWave signals, however, are prone to blockage due to human bodies. This paper presents a feasibility study of using mmWave for wireless power transfer in a large-scale network consisting of power beacons and energy harvesters. Using stochastic geometry, system performance is characterized while treating the network nodes as potential blockages to mmWave signals, thus coupling the network density and blockage density. For both mmWave and sub 6 GHz bands, analytical expressions are derived for a link-level metric (energy coverage probability) and a network-level metric (success probability) when the harvesters are served using time-division multiplexing. The former characterizes the survival function of the harvested energy, while the latter also takes the network load into account. Numerical simulations suggest that network densification helps improve the performance, despite an increase in the blockage density. For a given network density, deploying an optimal fraction of nodes as power beacons maximizes the number of successful energy harvesters per unit area. Finally, mmWave may potentially outperform lower frequency solutions despite blockages.},

abstract={Coordination among workers within a collaborative team environment is a key factor to its success but it is challenging to come up with a general model for relative costs and benefits of coordination. In a typical work environment, teams with sufficient aggregate expertise are selected to work on an incoming sequence of tasks one by one; it is often the case that the cost of coordination among the same set of workers within a team decreases over time for future tasks of similar difficulty since the workers get more familiar with each other. We study the problem of assigning available teams with adequate aggregate expertise to arriving tasks when the coordination cost can vary over time, as long as it does not increase over time. We propose an efficient team-to-task assignment algorithm that minimizes aggregate costs (due to assignment, coordination and context-switching). The algorithm automatically finds the number of times a specific team should be assigned to a task in the sequence by applying dynamic programming iteratively and guarantees a local optimal solution. We also study a strategy for team assembly in this time varying coordination cost scenario.},

pages={569-574}, 
abstract={In mobile Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs), the frequent link breakage and wireless interference urged the need for novel stable routing solutions. In this paper, we propose STAR, a stable routing protocol that aims at selecting interference-free and durable paths. We investigate the particular Hidden interfering Primary User (HIPU) problem caused by the un-detectable presence of the primary user in the transmission range of the secondary users resulting on severe packet loss. While existing CRNs routing solution, generally, overlook the interference caused by the Hidden Interfering Primary User (HIPU), STAR defines a HIPU-free transmission zone, that enables successful transmission and selects a stable route that is free from interference along the path to the destination. STAR uses prediction based model to estimate the link stability and the link propagation delay. To quantitatively select the best stable links along the route, STAR implements an objective function, cognitive stable link (CSL), that captures node mobility, interference by the HIPU, link propagation delay, and the distance towards the destination. We evaluate STAR, while comparing its throughput, latency, and packet loss ratio to three other protocols, namely PCTC, J-SRCA and AODV. Evaluation on MATLAB shows that STAR achieves higher throughput while reducing the end-to-end latency and the packet loss in the network.},

To weigh the benefits of narrow subbands, which permit narrowband beamforming for better interference rejection and signal gain, against the cost of a multiplicity of subbands, which is principally that of a high peak-to-average power ratio, we introduce an achievable rate metric.},

pages={418-423}, 
abstract={Opportunistic communications through wireless ad-hoc mesh networks have been thoroughly studied in the context of military infrastructureless deployments, sensor networks and even human-centered pervasive networking. However, due to the lack of a model that accurately computes the probability distribution of the delay, we usually content ourselves with the mean values. Such an approach can limit both the ability to predict the system's behavior and the ways to affect it. In this paper, we present an analytical framework that allows us to estimate the probability distribution of the delay as a function of the field size, the number of participating users and the movement model. In addition, the short computational time, as compared to simulations, allows us to analyze systems that would otherwise be infeasible, due to their size. The derived delay probability distribution can help us decide whether opportunistic networking can be practically used in, e.g., dense vehicular environments, highly volatile mesh networks, or even predicting a successful marketing campaign. We validate the analytical results against a simulation of the presented model. Furthermore, we created a second, highly sophisticated and realistic, simulation, in order to verify the validity of the observed trends in almost-real-life situations.},

title={A dataset generator for next generation system call host intrusion detection systems}, 
year={2017}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={231-236}, 
abstract={Over the years, system calls (syscalls) have become an increasingly popular data source for host intrusion detection systems (HIDS). This is partly due to their strong security semantic implications. As syscalls conform to a program's control-flow graph, a deviation in a syscall sequence may imply a deviation in a program's control-flow graph. This is useful for detecting the control-flow hijacking class of attacks. Additionally, malware must utilize syscalls in order to provide any utility to the attacker, with the exception of some denial-of-service attacks. Because all syscalls are observable from the kernel, this makes evasion difficult for attackers under syscall HIDS. Given their suitability for HIDS, many approaches based on syscalls have been proposed. However, the syscall datasets available are not always the most suitable for these and emerging techniques in analytics, as they may need additional structural or contextual information about syscalls in their decision engine. Furthermore, this flatness of previous datasets often pigeonholes solutions into those which are limited by that data view. It is also burdensome on the researcher to generate his own custom dataset. In this work, we propose an extensible syscall dataset generator which includes structural and limited contextual information regarding syscalls, yet allows for researchers to easily add their own features to more quickly develop and evaluate their systems. Our dataset generator can aid researchers in widening the solution space for syscall HIDS.},

abstract={Indoor target tracking has garnered interest as communication systems and mobile device capabilities advance. Visible light communication (VLC) is an alternative to RF methods that uses light emitting diodes. In this paper, probabilistic filtering algorithms (particle and extended Kalman filters) are used for indoor tracking. The performance of the filters is compared with an another positioning method: trilateration. Probabilistic filtering methods are shown to be more reliable than trilateration for indoor tracking when non-line-of-sight components are significant. The probabilistic filtering algorithms require a light intensity map that is collected as a fingerprint map prior to tracking. The effect of unpredictable shadowing as the conditions change is examined in a scenario where one of the lamps has been shadowed. Our algorithm tracks the user equipment with less error than trilateration. The results also show that the tracking accuracy for our algorithms is on the order of the grid resolution of the fingerprint map for high signal-to-noise ratio environments.},

abstract={The applications for MANETs have increased rapidly and today MANETs are capable of providing a variety of services. One of the major contributing factors is the availability of radios that are able to adapt to the channel conditions and can transmit at multiple data rates. A common approach for channel access is to employ a CSMA/CA based mechanism. However, these protocols tend to under perform at heavy loads or due to exposed/hidden nodes. One solution to this problem is to use a scheduling based MAC protocol. While transmission scheduling avoids collisions, these approaches often suffer from inefficient utilization of the channel. We investigate extensions to scheduling based MAC protocols that exploit the multirate transmission capability of the radios to increase the utilization of transmission assignments.},

We demonstrate the improvement our proposed scheme offers to the longevity of the network while maintaining similar performance as the original OLSR protocol. We devise a performance indicator to show in which cases our approach benefits the network system designer, depending on the priorities of the network application.

abstract={In this paper, we address the use of multi-layered sliding windows to detect the presence of a wireless network for cognitive radio applications. Although synchronization signals of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) has been used as the reference system, the proposed scheme is generic in principle. Our proposed scheme doesn't require any a priori knowledge of the exact synchronization sequences, so it can be classified as a coarse spectrum sensing technique. Firstly, the proposed detection scheme employs a sliding window technique to collect energies from the received primary synchronization sequence (PSS). After that, it uses the maximum of the energies collected from all windows as the decision statistic to detect the network coverage. We compared the proposed technique against other existing schemes that are commonly used in spectrum sensing. Depending on the channel condition and data transmission rate, our numerical results demonstrate that performance of the proposed scheme is more robust against the frequency selectivity of the channels.},

abstract={Currently deployed wireless and cellular positioning techniques are optimized for outdoor operation and cannot provide highly accurate location information in indoor environments. Meanwhile, new applications and services for mobile devices, including the recent Enhanced 911 (E911), require accurate indoor location information up to the room/suite level. In this work, a new system for improving indoor localization of mobile users is presented by exploiting trajectory tracking techniques using neural networks (NNs). The motion trajectories of indoor mobile users are tracked using conventional positioning algorithms, then a NN is applied to identify the current room location of a mobile user based on the tracked motion trajectory. Simulation results show that the trajectory-based NN is able to provide indoor location information at the room level with much higher accuracy in different scenarios, with an enhancement of up to 49% in correct room identification, as compared to positioning techniques based only on a single-point location estimate. In addition, miss-classification of the NN system will result in selecting one of the immediate neighboring rooms instead with at least 30% probability.},

abstract={Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS) offer real-time diagnostics of the status of a vehicle's tires via a wireless communications link back to the vehicle. These links, which provide data, mandated by the NHTSA, generally possess low security/low privacy, leading to a demonstrated potential for spoofing attacks or tracking a person/vehicle through the unencrypted emission of the tire's unique identifier. Due to the radiation pattern of the valve stem (used as the TPMS antenna), much of the signal is directed away from the vehicle. This paper investigates the possibility of decreasing the required signal strength by using the already existing accelerometer on the TPMS to detect the angle of the wheel and to transmit data at an optimal wheel orientation. This paper shows that the received signal strength at the vehicle receiver can differ by up to 20 dB between the best and worst orientations and provides a low computation option for estimating the angle of the wheel. Implementation of this algorithm or a similar algorithm would provide better battery life and better security for the TPMS while keeping cost the same.},

abstract={With the growing number of cyberattack incidents, organizations are required to have proactive knowledge on the cybersecurity landscape for efficiently defending their resources. To achieve this, organizations must develop the culture of sharing their threat information with others for effectively assessing the associated risks. However, sharing cybersecurity information is costly for the organizations due to the fact that the information conveys sensitive and private data. Hence, making the decision for sharing information is a challenging task and requires to resolve the trade-off between sharing advantages and privacy exposure. On the other hand, cybersecurity information exchange (CYBEX) management is crucial in stabilizing the system through setting the correct values for participation fees and sharing incentives. In this work, we model the interaction of organizations, CYBEX, and attackers involved in a sharing system using dynamic game. With devising appropriate payoff models for each player, we analyze the best strategies of the entities by incorporating the organizations' privacy component in the sharing model. Using the best response analysis, the simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed framework.},

year={2017}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={97-102}, 
abstract={This work considers the use of obfuscation against a global eavesdropper in a resource-constrained environment. We assume a network where network traffic (queries) is not always present on the network but is stochastic in nature. Even if the traffic is encrypted and the payload of packets are secure, under the threat of a passive adversary, activity over the links might be subjected to traffic analysis through network monitoring. To counter leakage of contextual information to such an adversary, the operator is able to mask the presence of traffic over a link if it normalizes link activity by adding chaffs. However, adding chaff to all links all the time might consume too much of the operators resources. Similarly, the adversary may try to eavesdrop over all links to observe any traffic pattern change to perform analysis. However, due to the bursty nature of link traffic and the high cost of operating and collecting information from all eavesdropping units, the adversary might not want or be able to operate all eavesdroppers simultaneously. The possibility that links may not be subject to eavesdropping might lead the operator to being more lenient in the use of chaff packets. If we incorporate operational (e.g. cost of chaffs) plus contextual (obfuscation score) costs as payoffs, we highlight the existence of a mixed strategy equilibria for employing chaff. The goal of this paper is to construct a two-player game that characterize the proper amount of chaff deployment given varying eavesdropping strategies. Several basic network examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of this mixed strategy which can be extended into larger scenarios. Our analysis uncovers counter-intuitive insights on the areas of the network for the adversary to eavesdrop. We also identify conditions for existence of pure strategy Nash Equilibrium for various settings like a two-hop network.},

Moving Target Defense over IPv6 (MT6D) employs an obscuration technique offering keyed access to hosts at a network level without altering existing network infrastructure. This is accomplished through cryptographic dynamic addressing, whereby a new network address is bound to an interface every few seconds in a coordinated manner. The goal of this research is to produce a Register Transfer Level (RTL) network security processor implementation to enable the production of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) variant of MT6D processor for wide deployment. RTL development is challenging in that it must provide system level functions that are normally provided by the Operating System's kernel and supported libraries. This paper presents the architectural design of a hardware engine for MT6D (HE-MT6D) and is complete in simulation.

abstract={Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET) are of particular importance in military communications. With the trend towards higher throughput requirements and spectrum congestion, researchers have looked at using multi-antenna techniques to enable concurrent transmissions within a one-hop MANET. However, the acquisition overhead has been shown to be a problem when dealing with concurrent transmission in MANET systems. Recently a novel time/resource efficient algorithm for frequency acquisition in concurrent MANETs has been proposed which uses simultaneous transmissions of Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence pairs. In this paper, we have prototyped this algorithm in hardware and have focused on validating its theoretically based claims and finding its performance limitations. We have been able to identify a series of hardware non idealities that affect the performance of the algorithm in practical schemes. We have performed indoor and outdoor experiments for Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) estimation and shown that the algorithm is able to achieve reliable CFO estimation using off the shelf hardware, all while attaining better (smaller) acquisition overhead.

pages={447-452}, 
abstract={It is a challenge today to set up novel data intensive services at UHF frequencies because the scarce spectrum is divided into a plethora of narrowband channels that have been allocated by regulatory agencies to different nations. Therefore, increasing the spectrum to be used for a single service is not a viable strategy. As an alternative, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) could be a candidate technology to increase the throughput in radio channels with fixed bandwidth. In this paper we focus on the application of spatial MIMO to UHF military satellite communications. We present UHF MIMO measurement results in a mobile satellite-to-car channel, where the car is equipped with non-directional antennas. The results quantify the capacity gains to be expected in case of a Rician satellite channel. We compare the measured channel capacities with a stationary setup as well as theoretical predictions evaluated by simulations. Due to the line-of-sight channel, a clear dependence of the channel capacity on the antenna array geometry can be observed. From the results we conclude that the maximum MIMO channel capacity can be achieved in both, stationary as well as mobile UHF scenarios.},

abstract={In this paper, a transmission mode selection scheme is proposed for device-to-device (D2D) communications underlay cellular networks, where potential D2D (p-D2D) users reuse the spectrum of uplink cellular users (CUEs). The developed framework is used to analyze and understand how the underlay D2D communication affects the cellular network performance. Unlike most of the previous researchers who only consider the performance for the full-duplex (FD) or half-duplex (HD) D2D network, we investigate the performance for hybrid FD/HD-D2D communications and propose a novel mode selection scheme for D2D users. In particular, we present a tractable analytical framework for a hybrid-duplex D2D-enabled cellular network, and the outage performances of the FD/HD-D2D receiver and the typical CUE are presented. Meanwhile, the spectral efficiency (SE) of the hybrid-duplex D2D-enabled cellular networks is given. Finally, numerical results are presented to verify the proposed scheme. From the simulation results, we can see that the proposed scheme can improve system SE.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a fully-integrated radar and communication system - named ComSens. We utilize two different pilot sequences (one for uplink and one for downlink) with the condition that they must be uncorrelated to each other. Within such a framework, the signal received from end-user and the back-scattered signal from the desired objects have uncorrelated pilots. Thus, the base-station is able to distinguish data signal from user and back-scattered signal from object. We assume a time division duplex (TDD) framework. The pilot sequences are designed for MIMO channels. We evaluate channel MSE as a figure of merit for communication system. We also show that the designed pilots are uncorrelated for a range of time lags. Moreover, designed uplink pilot has negligable autocorrelation for a range of time lags leading to an impulse-like autocorrelation for radar sensing.},

abstract={Cyber Defense Exercises have received much attention in recent years, and are increasingly becoming the cornerstone for ensuring readiness in this new domain. Crossed Swords is an exercise directed at training Red Team members for responsive cyber defense. However, prior iterations have revealed the need for automated and transparent real-time feedback systems to help participants improve their techniques and understand technical challenges. Feedback was too slow and players did not understand the visibility of their actions. We developed a novel and modular open-source framework to address this problem, dubbed Frankenstack. We used this framework during Crossed Swords 2017 execution and evaluated its effectiveness by interviewing participants and conducting an online survey. Due to the novelty of Red Team-centric exercises, very little academic research exists on providing real-time feedback during such exercises. Thus, this paper serves as a first foray into a novel research field.},

year={2017}, 
volume={},

pages={121-127}, 
abstract={Recently, automatic modulation classification techniques using convolutional neural networks on raw IQ samples have been investigated and show promise when compared to more traditional likelihood-based or feature-based techniques. While likelihood-based and feature-based techniques are effective, making classification decisions directly on the raw IQ samples allows for reduced system complexity and removes the need for expertly crafted transformations and feature extractions. In practice, RF environments are typically very dense, and a receiver must first detect and isolate each signal of interest before classification can be performed. The errors introduced by this detection and isolation process will affect the accuracy of convolutional neural networks making automatic modulation classification decisions using only raw IQ samples. To quantify this impact, a representative convolutional neural network designed to distinguish between 8 modulation classes (2FSK, 4FSK, 8FSK, BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK, 16QAM, and 64QAM), over a generalized parameter set, is analyzed. The classification accuracy of this neural network is investigated as a function of errors in carrier frequency estimation and errors in sample rate estimation. The importance of defining upper limits on frequency and sample rate estimation errors in a detector is highlighted, and the negative effects of over-estimating or under-estimating these limits is explored.},

abstract={Accessing the Internet through Wi-Fi networks offers an inexpensive alternative for offloading data from mobile broadband connections. Businesses such as fast food restaurants, coffee shops, hotels, and airports, provide complimentary Internet access to their customers through Wi-Fi networks. Clients can connect to the Wi-Fi hotspot using different wireless devices. However, network administrators may apply traffic shaping to control the wireless client's upload and download data rates. Such limitation is used to avoid overloading the hotspot, thus providing fair bandwidth allocation. Also, it allows for the collection of money from the client in order to have access to a faster Internet service. In this paper, we present a new technique to avoid bandwidth limitation imposed by Wi-Fi hotspots. The proposed method creates multiple virtual wireless clients using only one physical wireless interface card. Each virtual wireless client emulates a standalone wireless device. The combination of the individual bandwidth of each virtual wireless client results in an increase of the total bandwidth gained by the attacker. Our proposed technique was implemented and evaluated in a real-life environment with an increase in data rate up to 16 folds.},

pages={659-665}, 
abstract={Cognitive radio network (CRN) is regarded as an emerging technology for better spectrum efficiency where unlicensed secondary users (SUs) sense RF spectrum to find idle channels and access them opportunistically without causing any harmful interference to licensed primary users (PUs). However, RF spectrum sensing and sharing along with reconfigurable capabilities of SUs bring severe security vulnerabilities in the network. In this paper, we analyze physical-layer security (secrecy rates) of SUs in CRN in the presence of eavesdroppers, jammers and PU emulators (PUEs) where SUs compete not only with jammers and eavesdroppers who are trying to reduce SU's secrecy rates but also against PUEs who are trying to compel the SUs from their current channel by imitating the behavior of PUs. In addition, a legitimate SU competes with other SUs with a sharing attitude for dynamic spectrum access to gain a high secrecy rate, however, the malicious users (i.e., attackers) attempt to abuse the channels egotistically. The main contribution of this work is the design of a game theoretic approach to maximize utilities (that is proportional to secrecy rates) of SUs in the presence of eavesdroppers, jammers and PUEs. Furthermore, SUs use signal energy and cyclostationary feature detection along with location verification technique to detect PUEs. As the proposed approach is generic and considers different attackers, it can be particularized to a situation with eavesdroppers only, jammers only or PUEs only while evaluating physical-layer security of SUs in CRN. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using results obtained from simulations. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms other existing methods.},

With the widespread adoption of drones in IoT scenarios such as warfare, agriculture and delivery, effective solutions to protect data integrity and communications between drones and the control system have been in urgent demand to prevent potential vulnerabilities that may cause heavy losses. To secure drone communication during data collection and transmission, as well as preserve the integrity of collected data, we propose a distributed solution by utilizing blockchain technology along with the traditional cloud server. Instead of registering the drone itself to the blockchain, we anchor the hashed data records collected from drones to the blockchain network and generate a blockchain receipt for each data record stored in the cloud, reducing the burden of moving drones with the limit of battery and process capability while gaining enhanced security guarantee of the data. This paper presents the idea of securing drone data collection and communication in combination with a public blockchain for provisioning data integrity and cloud auditing. The evaluation shows that our system is a reliable and distributed system for drone data assurance and resilience with acceptable overhead and scalability for a large number of drones.},

abstract={The inherent nature of unattended sensors makes these devices most vulnerable to detection, exploitation, and denial in contested environments. Physical access is often cited as the easiest way to compromise any device or network. A new mechanism for mitigating these types of attacks developed under the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, ASD(R&E) project, “Smoke Screen in Cyberspace”, was previously demonstrated in a live, over-the-air experiment. Smoke Screen encrypts, slices up, and disburses redundant fragments of files throughout the network. This paper describes enhancements to the disbursement of the file fragments routing improving the efficiency and time to completion of fragment distribution by defining the exact route, fragments should take to the destination. This is the first step in defining a custom protocol for the discovery of participating nodes and the efficient distribution of fragments in a mobile network. Future work will focus on the movement of fragments to avoid traffic analysis and avoid the collection of the entire fragment set that would enable an adversary to reconstruct the original piece of data.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider the problem of direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation using electronically steerable parasitic array radiator (ESPAR) antenna based on compressive sensing. For an ESPAR antenna, the beampatterns and sparse model of DoA estimation problem in terms of overcomplete dictionary and sampling grid is presented. The DoA estimation problem is formulated as a mixed-norm ℓ2,1 minimization problem and the reactance domain multiple signal classification (RD-MUSIC) spatial spectrum for ESPAR antenna is introduced. Then, we propose reweighted greedy block coordinate descent (RW-GBCD) and reweighted ℓ2,1-SVD (RW-ℓ2,1-SVD) algorithms for DOA estimation using ESPAR. The performance of RW-GBCD for DoA estimation is compared to that of GBCD, ℓ2,1-SVD and RD-MUSIC algorithms. RW-GBCD benefits from less computational complexity compared to RW-ℓ2,1-SVD. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of RW-GBCD is better than that of GBCD and ℓ2,1-SVD. When angle separation is less than 10°, RW-ℓ2,1-SVD outperforms RW-GBCD. However, when angle separation is more than 10°, the performance of RW-GBCD in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) is approximately the same as that of RW-ℓ2,1-SVD.},

abstract={Cooperative spectrum sensing is often necessary in cognitive radios systems to localize a transmitter by fusing the measurements from multiple sensing radios. However, revealing spectrum sensing information also generally leaks information about the location of the radio that made those measurements. We propose a protocol for performing cooperative spectrum sensing while preserving the privacy of the sensing radios. In this protocol, radios fuse sensing information through a distributed particle filter based on a tree structure. All sensing information is encrypted using public-key cryptography, and one of the radios serves as an anonymizer, whose role is to break the connection between the sensing radios and the public keys they use. We consider a semi-honest (honest-but-curious) adversary model in which there is at most a single adversary that is internal to the sensing network and complies with the specified protocol but wishes to determine information about the other participants. Under this scenario, an adversary may learn the sensing information of some of the radios, but it does not have any way to tie that information to a particular radio's identity. We test the performance of our proposed distributed, tree-based particle filter using physical measurements of FM broadcast stations.},

abstract={The future of sensor systems is moving quickly to the realm of distributed multi-static RF Internet of Things (RIOTs). In this case, any single sensor is limited in its ability to generate useful information but the community of sensors, networked together, create the necessary information. Specifically, the ability to geolocate and track small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) with a set of distributed multi-static mobile RIOTs, e.g. RIOTs on a swarm of UASs, will become more the norm than an anomaly. Optimally networked swarms of small, inexpensive, mobile, unmanned platforms outfitted with RIOTS into an effective sensor suite is a difficult task. In this paper, rather than treat each RIOT as an individual sensor managed individually by the local platform, we demonstrate techniques for creating Software Defined Networks (SDNs) of RIOTS organized at the RF pulse level providing the ability to perform novel methods of detecting, geolocating and tracking both active emitters and passive reflectors of RF signals in highly dynamic environments.},

abstract={This paper introduces a framework for super-resolution of scalable video based on compressive sensing and sparse representation of residual frames in reconnaissance and surveillance applications. We exploit efficient compressive sampling and sparse reconstruction algorithms to super-resolve the video sequence with respect to different compression rates. We use the sparsity of residual information in residual frames as the key point in devising our framework. Moreover, a controlling factor as the compressibility threshold to control the complexity-performance trade-off is defined. Numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of the proposed framework in terms of the compression rate as well as the quality of reconstructed video sequence in terms of PSNR measure. The framework leads to a more efficient compression rate and higher video quality compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms considering performance-complexity trade-offs.},

abstract={Wireless communications networks are often modeled as graphs in which the vertices represent wireless devices and the edges represent the communication links between them. However, graphs fail to capture the time-varying nature of wireless networks. Temporal networks are graphs in which the sets of nodes or edges are time-varying. We consider the most common case, in which the set of nodes is fixed but the presence of edges changes over time. Most previous work on analyzing temporal networks has focused on summary measures that combine the contributions of different paths by using different weights for paths with different delays. Such summary measures are efficient to compute but may lose valuable information about the temporal behavior of the network. We propose techniques that characterize the delays of all paths between nodes in temporal networks. We then apply these techniques to identify dominant patterns in the temporal paths connecting nodes. Example temporal networks are used to illustrate these phenomena, and we consider implications to wireless networks.},

The most recent example that highlights the severity of the problem is the Mirai family of malware, which is accountable for a plethora of massive DDoS attacks of unprecedented volume and diversity. The aim of this paper is to offer a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of the IoT botnet landscape and the underlying reasons of its success with a particular focus on Mirai and major similar worms.

pages={629-634}, 
abstract={Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) has seen a growing interest in recent years due to spectrum scarcity. Cognitive radio is a necessary component to enable DSA. One key requirement for cognitive radio is the ability to blindly detect the presence of signals in time and frequency. One popular method for blind detection is computing a power spectral density estimate using the Welch periodogram. The Welch periodogram is optimally efficient under the assumption that received signals are in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise. However, the Welch periodogram is not robust against non-Gaussian noise. Robustness against non-Gaussian noise is desirable because many man-made devices - such as microwave ovens, WiFi co-channel, gas emissions, etc. - contaminate the spectrum with non-Gaussian noise. In this work, robust estimation techniques are applied to the Welch method to increase its robustness against non-Gaussian noise at the cost of estimation efficiency and computational ease. The increase in robustness of the modified Welch method (compared to the traditional Welch method) is demonstrated for the Middleton Class A non-Gaussian noise model. These robust techniques are shown to enable more reliable detection of signals contaminated by non-Gaussian noise.},

abstract={Malware infection activities need to be detected as early as possible to minimize the adverse impact of malware delivery, infection, exploitation, and spreading. Given that cybersecurity observations over a network are usually incomplete, noisy, uncertain, and need to be extracted from a big data size, it is a challenge to extract quality information for identifying vulnerable, infected, or exploited assets and then taking appropriate actions to mitigate the impact of malware infection and spread. This paper presents an integrated model of logistic regression and Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) along with online data analytics on temporal causality and dependency relationships of observations. New regression and malware infection features are developed by capturing and formulating the cross relationships of observations. Logistic regression of these new features is used to estimate the initial probability values that sensor measurements are indicative of vulnerability exploitations, which help infer the infection status of those assets associated with the vulnerabilities to be likely exploited. The results of the logistic regression on the infection status of assets are considered as the initial belief state of POMDP. The integrated model of logistic regression and POMDP is designed to iteratively collaborate in identifying and controlling malware infection and spread. Experimental results show the efficiency of having such collaboration in identifying and controlling malware-infected assets.},

pages={147-152}, 
abstract={The Wideband Global SATCOM system (WGS) satellite has the unique means to set sub-channel (SC) gain for a specific link or bandwidth segment. Certain Ka-band antennas can switch to an orthogonal circular polarization (CP) to use the identical frequencies more than once in the same geographic location. This allows planners to boost total capacity in an area of operations (AOR) without adding assigned bandwidth. The unique properties of CP make estimating cross-polarization interference (XPI) difficult. The concern of XPI is the extra expenditure of satellite resources. This paper shows a method to mitigate uplink XPI. It will show a method to determine the channel gain as a function of uplink SNR, intermodulation (IM) noise, and uplink XPI. This paper builds on previous works from Marshall [1], Knab [2], and Gonzalez [7].},

year={2017},

pages={209-213}, 
abstract={Civil aviation is continuing to grow, and along with growth in numbers of flights and passengers comes growth in communications. In particular airport surface environments are one of the areas in which rapid development of communication systems is taking place. Several years ago the Federal Aviation Administration, EUROCONTROL, and the International Civil Aviation Organization proposed a communication system based on WiMAX technology for airport surface areas: AeroMACS. The AeroMACS communication system is designed for civil aircraft but could also be applied to military airports as well. In this paper we investigate a new communication system for the unique airport surface environment. Our system has physical layer specifications similar to the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) approach used in AeroMACS, but is instead based on the filterbank multicarrier (FBMC) technique. Via computer simulations, using channel models based on measured data collected by NASA Glenn Research Center, we illustrate the FBMC advantages over AeroMACS. Our results show that using zero-forcing or least-square (LS) channel estimation techniques, FBMC and AeroMACS have similar performance, but FBMC affords a significant gain in throughput. Although FBMC has slightly worse bit error ratio (BER) performance than AeroMACS at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) the throughput advantage of the proposed FBMC design is approximately 23 percent.},

abstract={Cyber defense today relies heavily on teams of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), e.g., Cyber Protection Teams (CPTs). Although simple tasks can be automated or scripted, complex decision processes-increasingly needed to counter cyber threats-require SME insight and manual execution. As a result, cyber-defense operations tend to emphasize collection and archiving of data over real-time decision making and response, postponing actionable analysis and response until later, where “later” is frequently “too late.” In contrast, adversaries are readily using automation tools to minimize manual work and encapsulate autonomous behaviors into botnets and viruses that adapt to changing conditions. This imbalance puts the adversary in a position of advantage, a situation the research presented in this paper aims to remedy. The scarcity of cyber SMEs and the high cost of involving them in manual cyber responses are among the main factors contributing to the imbalance. The approach we describe aims to reduce the reliance on human SMEs, drive down the cost, and increase the effectiveness of CPTs by capturing expert knowledge in a tool that will automate the identification of known and unknown threats and the launching of mitigations to counter ongoing attacks at system speeds.},

year={2016},

pages={13-18}, 
abstract={In 2011, the United States (U.S.) Department of Defense (DOD) named cyberspace a new operational domain. As cyberspace is significantly different from the physical domain in the dimensions of time and space, it presents a much more dynamic and complex operational environment for the U.S. military. Yet, the DOD is currently applying command and control (C2) concepts developed for operations in physical space to operations conducted in cyberspace. The challenge facing the DOD is that it does not yet understand the factors related to C2 agility for the cyberspace domain, nor does it possess strategies to implement agile C2 in the face of the complex dynamics presented by this domain. The purpose of this exploratory research is to accurately frame the cyberspace operations C2 challenge and to identify an initial set of factors related to agility in one dimension of the C2 problem space. This research used a 3-round Delphi study to identify the factors related to the agility in allocating the decision-making rights necessary to make high quality decisions for cyberspace operations. This survey of 31 experts in cyberspace operations yielded an initial prioritized list of 21 factors related to the U.S. military's agility in allocating decision-making rights for cyberspace operations. The top five factors identified were: command intent, cyberspace situational awareness, command authorities and relationships, legal authorities and rules of engagement, and education and expertise. The results of this study suggest that the United States Department of Defense should examine its current command and control doctrine to determine the more agile decision-making methods for conducting cyberspace operations called for by the Commander of United States Cyber Command.},

abstract={Mission success and effectiveness depends on timely, secured delivery of information to authorized personnel or systems. Unfortunately, the current security paradigm of building a fortress to protect systems in the network is not sufficient in cyberspace. Further access control measures, such as role-based permissions, to prevent intrusions/disruptions are also insufficient. We present an alternative mission-based approach to a more granular access control paradigm, based on 14 years of research and pilot efforts. This distributed security approach has no need for passwords or system accounts, thus eliminating the associated management overhead. At each step in the authorization process, the system determines validated identities and claims for appropriate access and privileges. The techniques employed are resilient, secure, extensible, and scalable. The system, called Enterprise Level Security (ELS), is currently being researched. This paper discusses the ELS, a web-based security architecture designed to select and incorporate technology into a cohesive set of policies and rules for an enterprise information system. ELS provides application and data level access control automatically, based on the warfighter's current mission profile. As the warfighter's profile changes, authorized accesses are automatically deleted and new ones established to provide relevant, least privileged, mission information at the time of need. The paper begins by introducing ELS, its design principles and architecture, along with its foundational role in developing a forward-looking enterprise baseline; then, it continues by presenting ELS' current status and performance metrics, along with future plans for expansion of capabilities.},

pages={37-42}, 
abstract={In computerized systems, documents with sensitive information are generated, stored and accessed every day in large volumes. These documents are classified and disseminated only to appropriate personnel. Unintentional disclosure of sensitive information should be ultimately avoided. How to effectively provide access control of document disclosure is a key for secure business, government and military operations. Traditional access control is based on a simple rule, i.e., to test whether a user account that requests the access to information has been granted such an access. However, this design has been shown to provide no security guarantee due to emerging incidents including insider threats, account hacking, and human classification errors. In this paper, we propose a new access control mechanism based on a flexible decision design, which will not simply guarantee access to a document when a user account has been granted such an access, but comprehensively use text analysis and behavior analysis in a complementary way to quantify the risk of information disclosure and grant the access only if the risk is assessed low. Our evaluation based on notional documents demonstrates the effectiveness of this new access control design against erroneous document classification and malicious user behavior. The proposed access control mechanism shows potential to enhance the overall security in today's access control systems for document management.},

abstract={With the development of mobile communication technology, space information network plays an essential role in meeting the increasing demands of mobile communications. As a basic and powerful security mechanism, authentication protocol provides primary protection. In 2012, Zheng et al. proposed an efficient four-phase authentication scheme for space information network. But we observed that it is vulnerable to various attacks, such as the identity spoofing attack, malicious service request attack and denial of service attack. In this paper, we analyze the protocol in detail. Then an improved authentication scheme based on the self-renewal and timeout retransmission mechanism of user's temporary identity is proposed. The formal verification with SVO logic proves that the proposed authentication protocol is secure.},

abstract={Machine learning models are frequently used to solve complex security problems, as well as to make decisions in sensitive situations like guiding autonomous vehicles or predicting financial market behaviors. Previous efforts have shown that numerous machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial manipulations of their inputs taking the form of adversarial samples. Such inputs are crafted by adding carefully selected perturbations to legitimate inputs so as to force the machine learning model to misbehave, for instance by outputting a wrong class if the machine learning task of interest is classification. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, all previous work on adversarial samples crafting for neural networks considered models used to solve classification tasks, most frequently in computer vision applications. In this paper, we investigate adversarial input sequences for recurrent neural networks processing sequential data. We show that the classes of algorithms introduced previously to craft adversarial samples misclassified by feed-forward neural networks can be adapted to recurrent neural networks. In a experiment, we show that adversaries can craft adversarial sequences misleading both categorical and sequential recurrent neural networks.},

abstract={In mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) where there is no centralized control, distributed channel-access transmission scheduling protocols are of interest. Many scheduling-based MAC protocols have been proposed that provide contention free transmissions and can guarantee certain levels of performance. One of the major drawbacks of these protocols is that once slots are assigned to a particular node, if the node does not have a packet to transmit, then these slots are not utilized. In our proposed protocol these un-utilized assigned slots are recovered by other nodes, which results in an increase in the capacity of the network.},

abstract={We study a random access scheme for satellite packet communication with intentional interference. A modified Slotted ALOHA protocol is used with interferer power sensing to achieve maximum user throughput. For a malicious interferer who ignores the control parameters broadcast by the satellite (such as the back-off parameter), we show that the degradation of channel throughput is inversely proportional to the rate at which the interferer transmits on time slots. Next, we provide a new set of feedback parameters using dynamic estimates of the number of backlogged packets in the system as well as the estimated power of the interferer. We then estimate the transmission rate of the interferer using authentication and observed channel feedback. Finally, we simulate the performance of an ALOHA channel subjected to an interferer using both the original and a modified Rivest algorithm. We show that the unmodified Rivest algorithm performs close to the maximum achievable throughput for most interferer transmission rates despite an increasing overestimation of the number of backlogged packets in the system. We also show that the modified Rivest algorithm achieves slightly higher throughput and a much better estimate of the number of backlogged packets in the system under the same conditions. For the stationary interferer considered, the propagation delay of the channel has little effect on achievable throughput.},

pages={85-90}, 
abstract={Energy harvesting (EH) enabled relaying has attracted considerable attentions as an effective way to prolong the operation time of energy-constrained networks and extend coverage beside desired survivability and rate of transmission. In most existing literatures, the Harvest-Store-Use (HSU) model is utilized to describe the energy flow behavior of the EH system. However, the half-duplex (HD) constraint of HSU that harvested energy can only be used after being temporally stored in energy storage unit may reduce effective transmission time. Thus, we first construct the full-duplex (FD) energy flow behavior model of the EH system where the harvested energy can be tuned to power load and being stored simultaneously, and then prove the FD model is equivalent to the HSU model when time interval is small enough. Considering some key physical variabilities, e.g., the wireless channel and the amount of harvested energy, we further study the transmission optimization problem to improve the utilization of the harvested energy by optimizing the short-term throughput. Finally, to numerically obtain the optimized short-term throughput, we propose the adaptive relaying algorithm, including power control for source and relay nodes, relay selection and dynamic switching among four relay transmission modes, namely, HD amplify-and-forward (AF), HD decode-and-forward (DF), FD AF and FD DF. Results show that short-term throughput of the system can be improved through adaptive relaying in the proposed algorithm.},

abstract={With acoustic-electric channels, it is possible to send data through metallic barriers at very high rates while also transferring power. However, some isolated sensing situations require a lower complexity solution that is both small in size and low-power. This paper describes a simple low-rate communication method optimized for use with a battery-powered wireless sensor using amplitude modulation, envelope detection, and common modules found in commercially available microcontrollers. The data transfer algorithms rely on reduced computational operations making them suitable for microcontroller cores with limited processing power and memory. Additionally, the system is able to transfer power for recharging a battery, eliminating the need for physically accessing the sensor at any time. Bi-directional, half-duplex transfer of data at 2.7 kbps with a low bit error rate (BER) is demonstrated experimentally. A smart sensor that uses the technology, the Autonomous Intelligent Sensor Tracking System‡ (AISTS), is described.},

abstract={Low probability of detection (LPD) communication refers to reliable transmission of information that is difficult to detect by an unauthorised adversary. This paper studies LPD communication over parallel Gaussian channels, which are used to model a variety of communication scenarios. First a lower bound on the miss detection probability is derived assuming the adversary employs Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing. It is shown that at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the LPD constraint is equivalent to a constraint on the adversary's mean-square SNR. The optimal power allocation strategy that maximises the achievable number of transmitted information bits per codeword under constraints on the receiver's decoding error probability and the adversary's detection probability is analysed. Intuitively, it is shown that the optimal strategy favours channels where the receiver's noise power is low relative to that of the adversary's. Furthermore, as the block length increases, the optimal power allocation is simply a weighted version of the adversary's noise power profile, where the weights are the ratio of the adversary and receiver's noise power.},

abstract={This paper presents an analytical model of a multi-layer (social-communication) network supported with on-the-fly learned and prior social-cognitive features. In this model, routing is formulated in a distributed setting where each node operating with local information only finds the next-hop node, among all social and mobile ad hoc network (MANET) communication link neighbors, whose normalized delay is the smallest. This approach minimizes the end-to-end delay and readily extends to optimize other metrics, e.g., success probability. Delay performance is analytically evaluated as a function of distance to the destination node, which is estimated in social-cognitive learning under two social-cognitive features, frequency of encounters and social pressure metric. Different mobility models (random waypoint and group) are considered for the communication topology and different graph models (uniform random or scale-free) are considered for the underlying social network. Analysis is provided for both infinite and finite node models with different levels of granularity. In addition, real social network data is used to evaluate the analysis. Results show that online learning can closely track the actual distances to the destination and the expected delay with learning is close to that with perfect knowledge of network dynamics, while it saturates with hop distance, implying that the small-world phenomenon is captured.},

abstract={With the rapid development of the internet of things, location information becomes increasingly important for various applications. However, the localization information of network devices are vulnerable to various attacks. In this paper, we propose SPIN, a scheme for location verification that allows the access point (AP) to verify credibility of a reported location from a network node. This is achieved by having an object move actively around the AP at a random speed. The moving object blocks the direct path between the AP and individual network nodes at a random time and deliberately creates abrupt changes in the received signal strength (RSS). This paper proposes a scheme so that the AP can distinguish a malicious node from a legitimate one based on the reported RSSs from a network node and its reported location information. Simulation results show that the proposed SPIN scheme achieves high probability of detecting a malicious node and low probability of treating a legitimate node as malicious.},

abstract={This paper studies a jamming statistics-dependent frequency-hopping (FH) pattern generation scheme. Most existing FH patterns are determined by two encryption keys: (a) one for FH in the frequency domain, and (b) the other for time permutation in the time domain. These keys are independent of channel conditions. Hence, an FH signal generated by these two keys occupies the entire spectrum in both frequency and time domains, and the probability of detection by a jammer is low. However, the probability of a hit (or jamming) on the desired user's frequency channels by partial-band noise jamming (PBNJ) can be high because it is inversely proportional to the total number of available frequency positions. Can an FH system with jamming-dependent adaptive FH patterns safeguard the communications systems more effectively? If the answer is yes, then how can an efficient jamming-dependent adaptive FH pattern be found, and can it be implemented cost-effectively for future communications systems against jamming? The aim of this paper is to study answers to the questions posed here.},

pages={156-161}, 
abstract={In this paper, a minimax anti-jamming strategy in a frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS)/quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) satellite communication system is developed. The goal of the anti-jammer is to minimize symbol error probability while that of the jammer is to maximize it. The jammer attacks legitimate communication system via two jamming strategies: single-tone jamming and full-band multitone jamming. The jammer maximizes symbol error probability by changing strategies and jamming signal phases. The anti-jammer minimizes symbol error probability by changing decision thresholds when demodulating QPSK signals. The optimal anti-jammer under the worst jamming case is obtained by solving a minimax optimization problem numerically. Numerical results show that when the anti-jammer has no prior knowledge of the phase of the jamming signal, the best decision thresholds are the same as those in the case without attacks. The anti-jammer is able to reduce symbol error probability by increasing signal power or employing more frequency hopping channels. If the jammer knows the anti-jammer's minimax decision thresholds, it is better for the jammer to use single-tone jamming when the jamming power is low or the number of frequency hopping channels is large; when jamming power is high or the number of frequency hopping channels is small, full-band multitone jamming should be used.},

abstract={In this paper, we study the secrecy capacity of an underlay cooperative cognitive radio network (CCRN) where multiple relays are deployed to assist the secondary transmission. An optimal power allocation algorithm is proposed for the secondary transmitter and secondary relays to obtain the maximum secrecy capacity while satisfy the interference power constraint at the primary receiver and the transmit power budget of the CCRN. Since the optimization problem for the secrecy capacity is non-convex, we utilize an approximation and fitting method to convert the optimization problem into a geometric programming problem which then is solved by applying the Logarithmic barrier function. Numerical results are provided to study the effect of network parameters on the secrecy capacity. Through the numerical results, the advantage of the proposed power allocation algorithm compared to equal power allocation can also be observed.},

pages={168-173}, 
abstract={The ability to provide accurate spectrum sensing and decision making under an uncertainty environment is proving useful for the military SATCOM to increases the spectrum utilization. Dynamic spectrum access(DSA) allows a secondary user to access the spectrum holes that are not occupied by the primary users. However, the spectrum sensing for DSA is normally performed in a complex SATCOM environment under uncertainty, caused by the high GEO/LEO mobility, weak signals after a long distance of propagation, the high interference and jamming in an adversarial environment, etc. The uncertainty results in a high error probability in the spectrum sensing. In such a case, DSA requires a decision-making process to optimally determine which channels to sense and access. In this paper, we propose an approach for optimal spectrum sensing and decision making that mathematically models the uncertainty in the SATCOM while the whole system throughput is maximized. Specifically, we model the DSA with decision making as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) problem. Optimal DSA strategy has been discussed by an optimization process. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out and our simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed DSA strategy.},

pages={174-179}, 
abstract={In this paper, we focus on the problem of how to realize secure sensing in a comprehensive hostile cognitive radio network where both PUEA and SSDF are present, while most existing research regarding secure sensing treats Primary User Emulation Attack (PUEA) and Spectrum Sensing Data Falsification (SSDF) separately. The problem arises from the coexistence of PUEA and SSDF that even if PUEA is successfully identified, its neighboring honest users would unintentionally send contaminated sensing reports, and thus leading to unsafe sensing performance. An ideal and straightforward solution is to directly exclude those attacked secondary users from the sensing cooperation process. However, this scheme requires perfect information such as the attacking strength, geographical locations of secondary users, etc. To alleviate this requirement, a secure sensing algorithm is proposed in this paper, which identifies attacked secondary users by incorporating the idea of unsupervised machine learning, without prior information on either the attack or secondary users. Further, to account for identification error and different reliabilities of SUs, an identity value is assigned and adaptively updated for each SU. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm has better performance than conventional secure sensing algorithm in presence of both PUEA and SSDF, and remains robust even in a highly stressed environment where a significant portion of the network is attacked. It is also demonstrated that, when the sensing SNR increases, the performance of the proposed algorithm asymptotically approaches the ideal solution where the attacked users are perfectly removed.},

abstract={We consider the problem of autonomous navigation of a mobile robot to a radio-frequency (RF) source in a sparse multipath environment, in which the channel has a few dominant propagation paths. We consider a scenario in which the mobile robot is equipped with a moderately directional antenna but has no knowledge of the channel path-loss exponent or number or position of the multipath reflectors in the environment. The directional antenna allows the mobile robot to use angle-of-arrival (AoA) information to infer the direction in which RF power is arriving from one or more propagation paths; however, the presence of multipath and the wide beam of the directional antenna makes it very challenging to determine the location of the source from measurements at a single location. To overcome this, the mobile robot uses measurements at multiple locations and fuses the measurements using a particle filter. In turn, the robot is moved in the direction of one of the surviving particles after each particle filter update. We evaluate the performance experimentally using software-defined radios and a Turtlebot 2 robot in a controlled multipath environment, and we also simulate the performance using a ray-tracing model. Both sets of results show that this is a viable approach for navigating an autonomous vehicle to an RF source.},

abstract={Pseudolite-based systems and airborne relay-based positioning system (ARPS) have a limitation wherein the position error increases as the distance between the user and the area where the segments of the system are configured increases, owing to the low altitude of the navigation signal transmitters. To enhance the accuracy of the user, we propose a self-correction scheme based on the ARPS. In the proposed correction scheme, each reference station adjusts the transmission time of the navigation signal. This adjustment time is determined by calculating the average pseudorange differences between the true/estimated positions of the reference station and the estimated position of each airborne relay. Regardless of this adjustment, the user estimates the positions of the airborne relays and its own based on the original transmission time. Owing to this characteristic, the pseudorange errors that are included during the signal propagation are corrected and the accuracies of the airborne relays and the user are improved. Simulation results show that the proposed correction scheme reduces the error of the user, and the user in an enemy area can be provided with a relatively high accuracy service without the aid of correction messages.},

abstract={The need for physical layer security techniques is increasing with the deployments of machine to machine (M2M), internet of things (IoT), and device to device (D2D) communications. An important aspect of physical layer security is to perform covert communications of a possibly unencrypted signal without allowing an eavesdropper to detect the signal. In this paper, cylindrical antenna arrays with a large number of elements are proposed in order to reach this objective. These arrays allow the transmission of both the useful signal to the destination and the jamming signal to the eavesdropper without resorting to the help of other nodes for relaying the signal and/or jamming the eavesdropper. In addition, these arrays can be used at the destination for enhancing the received signal level and/or jamming the eavesdropper simultaneously with the transmitter. Monte Carlo simulation results show that high levels of secrecy capacity can be achieved with the proposed approach.},

pages={219-224}, 
abstract={Future systems of the 5th generation are slated to use the mm-wave bands due to the large slices of bandwidth available at those frequencies. Relative to the contemporary microwave bands, to compensate for the harsh propagation conditions, highly directional communication using beamforming methods is necessary to achieve a level of reliable communication, however minimal. Due to the fragile nature of directional communication (especially in dense urban environments or high mobility environments), there is a need to understand the effect of blockages on the system performance. Blockages on links (post beamforming) necessitate time and power expensive mechanisms such as beam adaptation or even re-training the beam setup. In systems aiming for less than 1ms latency, this can be impracticable. While the channel modeling effort for mm-wave bands is underway, the nature of environmental blockages for outdoor cellular communications is still not well understood. In this paper, to study the impact of blockages, in addition to the real-world challenges of mm-wave communications, we propose a hierarchical blockage model where, an arbitrary path (LOS or NLOS) undergoes a blockage with probability p (model parameter) independent of the other paths. Our results show that, even in the event of an unblocked LOS, there is a notable degradation in the received SNR. We also show that the increase in the path loss due to a severe level of environmental blockages is about 15dB relative to environments with a low level of blockages, for a distance of 150m which is approximately the envisioned cell radius for 5G cellular systems. Thus implying that, the range of reliable communication shrinks in the presence of environmental blockages.},

abstract={Received Signal Strength (RSS) localization has the attraction of requiring only simple receiver hardware. The basic idea is to find the position estimate that is most consistent with the received signal power measurements observed at multiple known locations in the area of interest. A fundamental assumption is that the signal power measurement is proportional to the product of the reference emitter power, n0, and a distance dependent term of the form d-α̅, where d is the emitter to receiver separation and α̅ is the path loss exponent. In practice, α̅ depends on the environment and can vary over α̅ large range. There is often very limited a priori knowledge of α̅ anḋ0 available and the use of inaccurate values in the localization equations can adversely affect the accuracy of position estimates. This paper develops a new method, based on a linearizing variable constraint, for the estimation of α̅. The estimation of the emitter position and oḟ0 then follows directly. This estimator yields a performance similar to a two-stage weighted least squares scheme, but requires much less computation.},

However, Long Term Evolution (LTE) is used as the reference system to demonstrate its application and analysis. Our proposed scheme is a coarse spectrum sensing technique that requires no prior knowledge of the exact synchronization sequences. At first, the proposed detection scheme employs a sliding window technique to collect energies from the received signal. After that, it sorts out the collected energies in the descending order and performs a partial sum of the largest order statistics to discover the network coverage.

abstract={This paper examines the impact of satellite transponder nonlinearities on the performance of protected tactical waveform (PTW) for the return link (RL). The performance impact due to adjacent channels interference (ACI) and a partial band noise jammer (PBNJ) are considered in the paper. In this paper, a Shaleh model is used to model the transponder traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA). This TWTA is protected by a soft limiter to prevent TWTA operation in the saturation region. Impact of signal clipping due to this soft limiter under a PBNJ is also investigated. Computer simulations are performed using Digital Video Broadcasting - Satellite - Second generation (DVB-S2) forward error correcting (FEC) codes. In addition, a ground hub receiver does not assume knowledge of the channel information. Ground hub is required to estimate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and details of SNR estimation are also discussed in the paper.},

abstract={Protected tactical waveform (PTW) provides cost-efficient, jamming-resistant communications via both government and commercial satellites over multiple frequency bands such as the C-, Ku-, Ka-, and X-band. Frequency hopping (FH) was originally developed for secure communications by exploiting time-frequency diversity over a large spectrum. The anti-jamming feature of the frequency hopping technique helps communication systems improve the reliability of transmission. In this paper, we consider a secure channel group hopping (CGH) scheme in order to satisfy the needs of protected tactical satellite communication system. This scheme is proposed to ensure that each channel group hops to a new hopping spectrum in a pseudo-random manner during each hopping period, and different channel groups always transmit over non-overlapping frequency bands. Our analysis suggests that the proposed CGH scheme achieves collision-free frequency hopping among channel groups, such that a higher spectrum efficiency of the system can be obtained. Simulation results are provided to validate the performance of the proposed CGH scheme for PTW system.},

abstract={Sensed location data is subject to inference attacks by cybercriminals that aim to obtain the exact position of sensitive locations, such as the victim's home and work locations, to launch a variety of different attacks. Various Location-Privacy Preserving Mechanisms (LPPMs) exist to reduce the probability of success of inference attacks on location data. However, such mechanisms have been shown to be less effective when the adversary is informed of the protection mechanism adopted, also known as white-box attacks. We propose a novel approach that makes use of targeted agility maneuvers as a more robust defense against white-box attacks. Agility maneuvers are systematically activated in response to specific system events to rapidly and continuously control the rate of change in system configurations and increase diversity in the space of readings, which would decrease the probability of success of inference attacks by an adversary. Experimental results, performed on a real data set, show that the adoption of agility maneuvers reduces the probability of success of white-box attacks to 2.68% on average, compared to 56.92% when using state-of-the-art LPPMs.},

abstract={One of the greatest challenges facing 802.11 wireless local area network (WLAN) is to provide equivalent security to wired local area network (LAN). Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA-II), also referred to as IEEE 802.11i standard, is the current security mechanism for enterprise wireless networks. IEEE 802.11i standard depends upon IEEE 802.1X standard to authenticate and generate the main cryptographic key used to secure wireless network traffic. In a WPA-II enterprise network, capturing wireless frames during the authentication phase between the Access Point (AP) and an authorized wireless client will not compromise the security of the WLAN. However, an attacker can apply active dictionary attack by guessing the credentials used to access the wireless network. In this case, the attacker communicates directly with the Authentication Server (AS). The main downside of this attack is the low intensity of password guessing trials that the attacker can achieve, thus security community usually does not pay attention to such an attack. In this paper, we present a new attack scheme that can increase the intensity of guessing trials against WPA-II enterprise. The new scheme is based on using one wireless interface card to create multiple virtual wireless clients (VWCs), each VWC communicates with the Authentication Server as a standalone wireless client. We have developed a working prototype and our experiments show that the proposed scheme can improve the active dictionary guessing speed by more than 1700% compared to the traditional single wireless client attack.},

abstract={In most Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications the sensors forward their readings to a central sink or base station (BS). The unique role of the BS makes it a natural target for an adversary's attack. Even if a WSN employs conventional security mechanisms such as encryption and authentication, an adversary may apply traffic analysis techniques to locate the BS. This motivates a significant need for improved BS anonymity to protect the identity, role, and location of the BS. Previous work presented distributed beamforming as an effective anonymity-boosting technique. Such work evaluated the anonymity performance of distributed beamforming when its application is unknown to the adversary. In this paper we reinforce the use of distributed beamforming as a cross-layer anonymity-boosting technique, even when the adversary is fully aware of its application and adapts the attack strategy accordingly. Moreover, we demonstrate that a cross-layer implementation of distributed beamforming successfully misdirects such an adaptive adversary.},

year={2016}, 
volume={},

pages={277-282}, 
abstract={Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) are highly motivated and persistent, and they often operate in a stealthy way to avoid detection. Moreover, an advanced attacker may choose to approach insiders within the organization. Insider information can not only reduce the attack cost significantly but also make the attack more covert. Although stealthy attacks and insider threats have been considered separately in previous works, the coupling of the two is not well understood. As both types of threats are incentive driven, game theory is an appropriate tool to reason about the strategic behavior for each participant. We propose a non-zero sum three-player game model to study the interplay between APT and insider threats. Our model is built upon the two-player FlipIt game model for stealthy takeover with two extensions. First, we consider an asymmetric feedback structure where the defender is observable, while the attacker is stealthy and obtains delayed feedback about the defender's security updates. Second, we consider a three-player setting by introducing an insider with a double role, where it can help either the attacker or the defender according to the payoffs. We characterize the subgame perfect equilibria of a sequential game with the defender as the leader, and the insider and the attacker as the followers. We derive various insights from the game model, and discuss approaches for achieving more efficient defense in the face of both a stealthy attacker and an insider with double roles.},

abstract={The capability to reliably and accurately identify the attacker has long been believed as one of the most effective deterrents to an attack. Ideally, the attribution of cyber attack should be automated from the attack target all the way toward the attack source on the Internet in real-time. Real-time, network-wide attack attribution, however, is every challenging, and many people have doubted whether it is feasible to have practical attack attribution on the Internet. In this paper, we look into the problem, challenges of real-time attack attribution on the Internet, and analyze what it takes to have the real-time attack attribution on the Internet. We show that it is indeed feasible and practical to attribute certain cyber attacks on the Internet in real-time. We build such a real-time attack attribution system upon the malware immunization and packet flow watermarking techniques we have developed. We demonstrate the unprecedented real-time attack attribution capability via live experiments on the Internet and Tor nodes all over the world.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a delay-optimal packet scheduler for processing the M2M uplink traffic at the M2M application server (AS). Due to the delay-heterogeneity in uplink traffic, we classify it broadly into delay-tolerant and delay-sensitive traffic. We then map the diverse delay requirements of each class to sigmoidal functions of packet delay and formulate a utility-maximization problem that results in a proportionally fair delay-optimal scheduler. We note that solving this optimization problem is equivalent to solving for the optimal fraction of time each class is served with (preemptive) priority such that it maximizes the system utility. Using Monte-Carlo simulations for the queuing process at AS, we verify the correctness of the analytical result for optimal scheduler and show that it outperforms other state-of-the-art packet schedulers such as weighted round robin, max-weight scheduler, fair scheduler and priority scheduling. We also note that at higher traffic arrival rate, the proposed scheduler results in a near-minimal delay variance for the delay-sensitive traffic which is highly desirable. This comes at the expense of somewhat higher delay variance for delay-tolerant traffic which is usually acceptable due to its delay-tolerant nature.},

The age of information metric has been studied for a variety of different queuing systems, and in this work, we consider the impact of buffer sizes, packet deadlines, and packet replacement on the average age of information for queuing systems. We conduct a simulation-based study in which we modeled a wide variety of queuing systems and control mechanisms in simulation and computed the average age of information. We first study the buffer size alone to see how it affects the average age, and then we look at adding a packet deadline for such a system. We consider packet deadline control in the buffer only and in both the buffer and server, and we also compare the performance with a random deadline. We observe how the buffer size and deadline are optimized for the age, and we identify general trends for how to choose values of control mechanisms under different conditions of the packet generation rate. Lastly, we study the ability to replace packets in the buffer with newly arriving packets, and we are particularly interested in whether we can achieve the performance of such a system by controlling buffer size and deadline alone, for systems in which we do not have the ability to do packet replacement.},

abstract={Device-to-device (D2D) communication has been considered as a key technique in the fifth generation cellular networks. Power control is critical to ensure satisfactory performance. However, most existing power control schemes focus on delay-unaware metrics, such as throughput and power consumption, thus only applying to delay-insensitive scenarios. To overcome this problem, we in this paper consider a network where multiple D2D pairs with delay quality-of-service (QoS) requirements share a certain spectrum band. We propose an effective power control and source adaptation policy that maximizes the system throughput while satisfying each D2D pair's delay QoS requirement. Specifically, we formulate a constraint optimization problem which aims at maximizing the QoS-guaranteed system throughput. By using convex approximation, we convert the original non-convex optimization problem into a convex one. The optimal solution is derived via the Lagrangian approach. Moreover, to solve for the dual function with given dual variables, we propose an iterative algorithm based on alternating optimization and prove its convergence to the global optimum. Simulation results show that our proposed policy can improve the QoS-guaranteed system throughput significantly compared with the baselines.},

abstract={The sensory traffic in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications has fairly heterogeneous service delay requirements. Therefore, we study the delay-performance of a heterogeneous M2M uplink from the sensors to a M2M application server (AS) via M2M aggregators (MA). We classify the heterogeneous M2M traffic aggregated at AS into multiple Periodic Update (PU) and Event Driven (ED) classes. The PU arrivals are periodic and need to be processed by a prespecified firm service deadline whereas the ED arrivals are random with firm or soft real-time or non real-time service requirements. We use step and sigmoidal functions to represent the service utility for PU and ED packets respectively. We propose a delay efficient multiclass packet scheduling heuristic that aims to maximize a proportionally fair system utility metric. Specifically, the proposed scheduler prioritizes service to ED data while ensuring that the PU packets meet their service deadline. It also minimizes successive PU failures for critical applications by penalizing their occurrences. Furthermore, the failed PU packets are immediately cleared from the system so as to reduce network congestion. Using extensive simulations, we show that the proposed scheduler outperforms popular packet schedulers and the performance gap increases with heterogeneity in latency requirements and with greater penalty for PU failures in critical applications.},

Despite these advantages, communications using directional transceivers require establishment and maintenance of line-of-sight (LOS). Thus, establishment of the communication link or neighbor discovery plays an important role in mobile ad hoc networks with RF/FSO directional transceivers. We consider two nodes (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or Quadcopters) hovering in 3D space, each with one directional transceiver mounted on a mechanically steerable spherical structure/head, with which they can scan 360° in the horizontal plane and 360° in the vertical plane. We propose a novel scheme that deals with the problem of automatic discovery and establishment of LOS alignment between these nodes. We performed extensive simulations to show the effectiveness of the proposed neighbor discovery method. The results show that, using such mechanically steerable directional transceivers, it is possible to establish communication links to similar neighboring nodes within minimal discovery times.},

Due to the high cost of development and fielding such systems, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is seeking joint-service solutions that take in requirements from the Navy, Air Force, Army, and Marines. One of the challenges of the joint architecture is the differing routing architectures. The Navy prefers operating the provider network as layer 2 for simplicity, while the Air Force and Army requires layer 3 because many radio systems do not converge on Ethernet frames. In this paper, we examine the tradeoffs between layer 2 and layer 3 network on the high capacity airborne backbone and implement a software-based router that can support either approach. We evaluate both approaches with representative traffic and topologies to quantify performance in terms of convergence time, overhead and efficiency for each approach.},

abstract={Full duplex directional Radio Frequency (RF) / Free-Space-Optical (FSO) transceivers are envisioned to play a great role in future generation wireless networks. They provide benefits in terms of better throughput, enhanced spectrum utilization and lower interference from unwanted sources. However, the stringent requirement of line-of-sight (LOS) communication makes it tough for a mobile node to maintain a link without a-priori information about its neighbor's position. Hence, neighbor discovery takes a very crucial role in mobile ad hoc networks with directional transceivers. In this paper, we focus on neighbor discovery using full duplex directional transceivers. We consider two nodes that can discover each other by steering their transceivers with a randomly chosen angular speed and performing a simple three way handshaking protocol. We provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed neighbor discovery method.

abstract={The U.S. Department of Defense with the Joint Aerial Layer Network (JALN) concept as well as public companies like Google with their Loon project and Facebook with their solar-powered UAV concept have all invested significant funds to develop and deploy airborne high capacity backbone systems. These systems are intended to augment ground networks in support of disaster relief, to extend Internet access to infrastructure-less areas, and to support other similar missions. They can be used to replace existing satellite backbones which typically offer low capacity and high latency connections. One of the key challenges to building an airborne backbone network is large-scale topology management of directional links in a dynamic environment. In this paper, we present several topology management algorithms for large scale airborne networks and evaluate the performance of these algorithms under various scenarios. In each case, we seek to evaluate link and path availability of each algorithm.},

abstract={Satellite systems such as Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) networks play an important role in the next generation 5G networks. To facilitate the integration of satellite and terrestrial networks, software-defined networking (SDN) is embraced which brings flexibility, user-customized services and reduces the cost of network configurations. However, it has been long known that communications via LEO satellite network suffer from long delay and frequent ground-satellite handovers, both are problematic for TCP connections. The emergence of Multipath TCP (MPTCP) provides a new solution to these challenges. In this paper, we study the performance of MPTCP over SDN-enabled LEO satellite networks. MPTCP maintains multiple simultaneous subflows in space to increase throughput. In anticipation of handover, MPTCP creates subflows that run in backup mode and shifts traffic smoothly. To support MPTCP, we design an SDN controller that identifies MPTCP subflows attached to the same MPTCP session and splits them to disjoint paths. The SDN architecture centralizes the routing logic, so the system is more scalable and on-board processing is minimized. Simulations are run to evaluate the proposed MPTCP-SDN framework. It is shown that compared to previous solutions, our strategy significantly improves throughput performance and prevents the interruption of transmission during handover.},

year={2016}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={373-378}, 
abstract={High frequency bands (Ka band and above) are increasingly in vogue for feeder link connectivity between GEO satellites and their respective, possibly non-collocated, Gateways (GWs). At these frequencies, the return links of the VSATs (Very Small Aperture Terminals) experience a time and frequency dependent impairment due to rain events affecting the geographically diverse feeder links. In addition, as described in this paper, a frequency-dependent interference phenomenon is typically present on the feeder links of Ka band satellite systems. This paper describes a novel network-level and GW-centric signal processing algorithm for real-time estimation of the optimal uplink transmit power required at different VSATs in presence of feeder link impairments that exhibit these characteristics. In this algorithm, different VSATs report their individual estimates of the optimal uplink transmit power levels to the satellite GW. An adjacency-graph based linear algebraic method is employed at the GW for deriving the global estimate of the feeder link frequency-dependent transmit power levels based on the individual (or local) reports sent by each VSAT. A novelty of this estimation procedure is that it separates the impairments affecting the feeder from those on the mobile links from the end-to-end measurements. Finally, a scheme for compensation of the estimated variation in the link impairment levels is described. In this scheme, the nominal operating point of the Uplink Power Control (ULPC) process operating at each VSAT is periodically updated based on the estimate of the optimal uplink transmit power level. Resultant scheme for rain fade and interference mitigation provides an increase in the network-level spectral efficiency as well as a more robust operation of individual VSAT links with a reduced number of NACKs (Negative Acknowledgments).},

In low infrastructure areas such as mountain, battlefield, and in-flight, a geostationary (GEO) satellite system is regarded as an alternative solution to provide real-time voice services. In this paper, an effective bandwidth based capacity request for real-time voice traffic in military satellite system. First, the transparent satellite architecture for continuous rate assignment (CRA) request procedure is proposed. Next, for an accurate estimation of effective bandwidth, we implement a voice traffic model multiplexed in the return channel satellite terminals (RCST), which is originated from user terminals (UTs) and multiplexed in an RCST. Further, an analytical model is developed for evaluating the performance, such as the capacity requests, the number of available RCSTs, optimal medium access control (MAC) queue length, and ratio of resource waste. It is demonstrated that the proposed scheme has high efficiency of resource allocation, and low ratio of resource waste.},

abstract={Tackling the physical layer secrecy issue, existing studies on cooperative jamming generally assume the persistent jamming and perfect channel estimation at the receiver side. However, these two assumptions are incompatible since jamming signals can corrupt the pilot symbols. In addition, due to the energy budget limitation, persistent jamming is burdensome to the cooperative jammers. To address these issues, we propose a cooperative jamming strategy that designs the jamming symbols aiming only at the pilot signals to attain security improvement by manipulating the channel estimations at the authorized receiver and the eavesdropper simultaneously. Via computer simulations, we compare the performance of the proposed strategy with that of a conventional persistent artificial noise-aided strategy, and these results demonstrate that the proposed strategy achieves substantial secrecy rate gain in wide region, especially at the low data transmission power regime and at the rank-deficient environment.},

abstract={Signal source separation is an important aspect of both measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) as well as modern commercial smart grid applications. In some MASINT scenarios, real-time signal processing is required in a small physical form factor, which can become prohibitive with the high sample rates required of modern signal identification algorithms. We develop a new Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, the Aliased FFT (AFFT), that exploits spectral redundancy and sparsity in the signal to drastically reduce the number of computations required from O(N logN), for the normal FFT, to one that approaches the idealized O(K logK) for a K-sparse signal. We also develop a signal source separation algorithm using harmonically aligned signal projections (HASP) that is useful for transforming a one-dimensional signal of interest (SOI) into a two-dimensional image in such a way to facilitate automated feature extraction. An automated feature extractor is described which can accurately achieve super-resolution far beyond that of the traditional FFT by again taking advantage of the harmonic structure present in the SOI. We demonstrate HASP and this feature extractor for the application of load disaggregation-identifying the presence of certain types of devices connected to a power system.},

abstract={This paper investigates source localization in urban environments using machine learning methods. Both classification and regression schemes are examined using the random forest algorithm. In both approaches, the localization performance depends mostly on arrival time information of received signals. It is shown that the use of a relative arrival time difference rather than the direct time of arrival (TOA) also provide good performance, which is beneficial for practical application. It is found that with enough number of receivers, the signal power parameter can be omitted, which eliminates frequency dependency of developed models. It is also found that at least three receivers should be used to achieve acceptable prediction performance. Additionally, the number of training examples needed depends on the approach used as well as the desired level of accuracy. This factor is more important in the classification approach, as the amount of training data required closely relates to the number of sectors created by the localization problem. A regression scheme is more natural for predicting spatial coordinate values, and achieved higher localization accuracy with fewer training examples as compared to classification. Ultimately, the regression based localization scheme using the time difference of arrival (TDOA) parameter at three receiver locations achieved an average localization accuracy of 2.8m.},

abstract={Jamming is an ongoing threat that plagues wireless communications in contested areas. Unfortunately, jamming complexity and sophistication will continue to increase over time. The traditional approach to addressing the jamming threat is to harden radios, such that they sacrifice communications performance for more advanced jamming protection. To provide an escape from this trend, we propose a jammer exploitation strategy in which the communications system causes an enemy reactive jammer to act as an unwitting relay. Jammer exploitation against an enemy can be considered a form of antifragile electronic warfare, a recently introduced area of research within wireless security. Antifragility refers to systems that increase in capability, resilience, or robustness as a result of disorder (e.g., chaos, uncertainty, stress). An antifragile system is fundamentally different from one that is resilient (i.e., able to recover from failure) and robust (i.e., able to resist failure). The antifragile strategy proposed in this paper revolves around using a frequency-shift keying (FSK) waveform that is tuned in such a way to exploit the jammer's behavior. We derive the channel capacity and cutoff rate when using the waveform, and provided numerical results via simulation to gain further insight. Results show that an antifragile gain is achievable under a variety of reactive jamming scenarios.},

abstract={Parameter optimization such as power and time allocation plays an important role in emerging cooperative relaying protocol designs, especially when the environment is congested and contested. However, most existing works on cooperative relaying protocol designs considered equal-time allocation scenario, i.e. equal time duration is assigned to each source and each relay. In our recent work, we developed a decode-and-forward (DF) relaying protocol with linear mapping, where a significant performance improvement can be achieved by jointly optimizing power and time allocation. In this paper, we would like to explore optimum power and time allocation in amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying protocol designs, which has been widely considered in military/commercial communication applications. First, we design an AF relaying protocol based on an linear mapping approach for re-encoding at the relay which has shown superiority in our prior study. Then, we develop an optimum linear mapping for the AF protocol to minimize the outage probability. Finally, based on the optimum linear mapping, we obtain an optimum strategy of power and time allocation. It shows that one should always allocate more energy and time resources at the source than at the relay to minimize the outage probability of the AF relaying protocol. Numerical and simulation results validate our theoretical development.},

Our technique allows a receiver to exploit the broadcast nature of the wireless medium by overhearing packets sent by a node that is not necessarily one of the receiver's designated relays. Delivery of the file to the remote destinations is expedited by making efficient utilization of nodes that obtain the file from the source before the relay nodes obtain it. Nodes are not required to transmit multiple packets simultaneously or receive packets from multiple senders simultaneously. An adaptive modulation and channel coding protocol is used to mitigate the effects of fading and shadowing. Performance results are provided for two forms of network coding, fountain coding and random linear network coding.},

One of the most important issues is how the cell-edge users detect and decode the outcomes observed from the individual multi-streams of multi-codewords transmitted by two neighboring base stations. To address this problem, this paper presents a novel framework based on the network assisted interference cancellation and suppression (NAICS) technique. Its application to the scenario with two adjacent base stations and cellular-edge users is guided by two schemes. First, two base stations explicitly define and exchange the transmission policy for each codeword regarding the modulation index, the number of streams, and the order of the transmitted codewords. Second, a new taxonomy scheme is proposed, where the Bayesian decision classifier theory is used for the cell-edge users to extract the judgment rules from the exchanged transmission policy and enable symbols estimation and recognition in terms of posterior probability statements, hence offering a decision for each codeword. We introduce an integer optimization model subject to several practical constraints, such as the channel conditions of the users, the number of subcarriers, and the required throughput. The numerical tests demonstrate how to satisfy these requirements while validating the benefits over conventional approaches.},

abstract={We report on recent results from our ongoing work on demonstrating retrodirective transmission from distributed arrays. Specifically, we describe a successful experimental demonstration of retrodirective beamforming to a non-cooperating receiver from an array of three distributed transceivers using (mostly) off-the-shelf hardware and simple and standard signal processing techniques. We build on our recently reported work that describes a synchronization procedure that allows the array nodes to estimate and compensate for the combined effects of frequency offsets and drifts in the oscillators as well as nonreciprocal elements in the transceiver hardware. We show how the array nodes that have performed the above synchronization process can then use an opportunistic incoming transmission from an external target to perform retrodirective beamforming back to that target without any coordination with that target. Our experimental results show beamforming gains greater than 90%. A key distinguishing feature of our work is that our procedure requires no wired links between the array nodes, no GPS, nor any other shared signal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever demonstration of retrodirective beamforming from a fully wireless distributed array.},

abstract={Beamforming (BF) protocols introduced in IEEE 802.11ad and IEEE 802.15.3c for 60 GHz millimeter-wave (mmwave) communications perform exhaustive sector/beam search to setup a beamformed link between stations/devices. In this paper, we propose two BF methods, Binary Search Beamforming (BSB) and Linear Search Beamforming (LSB), to improve the BF setup time of adopted algorithms in IEEE 802.11ad and IEEE 802.15.3c. The paper's premises are that the line-of-sight (LOS) ray dominates the mmwave links and the sectors with the highest antenna gains are the ones around the LOS ray direction. Proposed algorithms aim to find the sector covers the LOS ray in fewer steps by ignoring a number of sectors using iterative algorithms. This reduces the BF setup time significantly and saves power but at the expense of increased bit error rate (BER) in some cases. We provide performance comparisons of both algorithms with exhaustive search. For an example setup based on the channel model for a 60GHz system, simulation results show that, with 60 sectors antenna, the conventional BF setup time is reduced to 1.1% and 2.2% with using LSB and BSB, respectively. While not sacrificing from error performance for any number of sectors in the case of LSB, this is valid for only smaller than 36 sectors for BSB. However, in this condition, BSB has an advantage of around 3 dB power saving during the BF setup compared to LSB.},

abstract={Femtocells and the device-to-device (D2D) communication can improve the system capacity in heterogeneous networks. To mitigate the interference caused by users in femtocells and improve the uplink capacity of femtocells, we investigate the users' uplink capacity maximization problem in D2D-enabled femtocells with channel allocation, mode selection and power control. Considering the rate requirement of cellular users and D2D users in femtocells and the interference limit of users served by the macro base station, the problem is formulated as a non-convex mixed integer optimization problem which is difficult to be solved directly. Firstly, the problem is transformed into a convex problem with the channel allocation variable relaxed. Then the dual decomposition method is utilized to solve the transformed problem. Numerical results confirm that the proposed method can enhance the uplink capacity of femtocells significantly.},

abstract={Blind identification of multiple channels using only second order statistics has been a subject of research since the early 1990s. Two methods of estimating multiple channels, the Cross-Relations (CR) and Noise Subspace (SS) methods, have received attention in previous works for their simple implementation and performance in situations where the channel identifiability conditions are easily met. However, in practice, this is not always the case, particularly since the conditions imply that the channel order is known. Channel order determination may also not be practical depending on the channels observed. Asymptotic results have been given in numerous works for both methods, with different prior distributions assumed for the signal, and under a quadratic (unit energy) constraint on the channels. Previous work has suggested that a linear constraint, as well as l-1 regularization to promote sparsity, may help improve performance when the channels are unidentifiable in practice due to unknown channel order. In this work, the CR and SS methods are reviewed, and the asymptotic performance of both methods is examined though theory and simulation under quadratic and linear constraints, as well as with regularization, when the transmitted signal is a real sequence of IID symbols.},

abstract={A barrage relay network (BRN) is a broadcast-oriented ad hoc network involving autonomous cooperative communication, a slotted time-division frame format, and a coarse slot-level synchronization. While inherently a broadcast protocol, BRNs can support unicast transmission by superimposing a plurality of controlled barrage regions (CBRs) onto the network. Within each CBRs, a new packet is injected by the unicast source during the first time slot of each new radio frame. When a CBRs is sufficiently long that a packet might not be able to reach the other end within a radio frame, multiple packets can be active at the same time via spatial pipelining, resulting in interference within the CBRs. In this paper, the dynamics of packet transmission within a CBRs is described as a Markov process, and the outage probability of each link within the CBRs is evaluated in closed form, thereby accounting for fading and co-channel interference. In order to account for the linkage between simultaneous active packets and their temporal correlation, a Viterbi-like algorithm is used. Using this accurate analytical framework, a line network is optimized, which identifies the code rate, the number of relays, and the length of a radio frame that maximizes the transport capacity.},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel multi-user multiple-input and multiple-output (MU-MIMO) selection and beamforming technique for a geosynchronous orbit (GSO) satellite communication (SATCOM) system. The MU-MIMO technique employs beam-forming and adaptive power allocation schemes in order to support a large numbers of users. Additionally, this paper provides a solution for the scenario where satellite ground terminals and cellular users are sharing the same spectrum band. The proposed MU-MIMO Selection And Beamforming (SAB) method makes it possible to constrain the interference created by a high powered satellite transponder, in order to maintain normal transceiving activity for commercial cellular users. Meanwhile the quality of service (QoS) is also satisfied for ground terminals. If the options of selectively serving certain users is available, the performance can be improved further in terms of constraining the interference level. The other novelty of this work is a robust channel estimation design to support the proposed MU-MIMO schemes with specifies the pilot structure design, such as the determination of proper pilot length and transmission power. Extensive simulation and numerical results illustrate and validate the theoretical development.},

abstract={Infamous recent cyber attacks on businesses and governments have demonstrated that even the best contemporary security systems can not prevent well-resourced adversaries from infiltrating their networks and gaining access to sensitive information. Stealthy malware can spread through a network undetected by utilizing zero-day exploits to propagate and hiding malicious behavior in normal activity, potentially doing significant damage before exploited vulnerabilities can be identified or patches developed. In this work, we consider a scenario in which an attacker deploys propagating malware enabling the exfiltration of data from infected devices, and a defender deploys detection and recovery mechanisms designed to control malware spread while obeying network-wide resource constraints. We use a stochastic model to represent changes in the state of the network and analytically derive an upper bound on the total rate at which an optimal attacker can exfiltrate data from the network, expressed in terms of several network parameters, when the detection rate is proportional to the outgoing data rate at each infected device. Our results can help inform cybersecurity decision-makers in judiciously allocating resources to manage risk.},

abstract={Proximity-based malware, such as cyber cellphone worms and trojans, has been identified to be one of the serious open threats to wireless networks operating at the tactical edge. The ability of malware to exploit the vulnerabilities of a wireless mobile platform is often a function of the mix of software and hardware which define its platform. In this paper, we utilize a proactive strategy which takes advantage of platform diversity metrics to defend against cyber worm attacks in tactical networks. This strategy uses dynamic K-Distance pruning to minimize the total number of shared edges between nodes with similar platforms while retaining access to mission-critical services. To achieve this we introduce a new neighborhood diversity metric and show how it can be used to limit the spread of malware in a multi-platform mobile network by reducing contact between machines with similar vulnerabilities. We test our assumptions via an agent-based simulation of epidemic malware in a synthetic tactical network.},

The behavior and threat posed by StuxMob are distinguishable from the existing state-of-the-art malware. Today's malware attack devices either just after the devices got infected or through a command-and-control based botnets. In contrast, StuxMob will launch its payload and perform a specific act against the target, only if it finds a match between a given profile and the person carrying the device; otherwise, it remains dormant.

abstract={Location information is utilized for a variety of purposes, such as military operation, Internet of Things, big data, and application services. Problems can occur if location information is exposed, such as a higher likelihood of crime and invasion of privacy. In the battlefield, exposed location data can lead to significant losses because of the exposure of military secrets and operation information. Existing transformation schemes to protect location data have been studied. However, such schemes are not suitable for real-time processing systems that use location data because transformation processing requires too much time. In order to solve this problem, we propose a Point Transformation Scheme (PTS) for location data privacy. PTS has symmetry movement by selecting a direction based on previous location data. The proposed scheme makes complex transformation processes simple compared with conventional schemes. This way, processing time can be reduced to be suitable for real-time processing systems. In addition, location data of the proposed scheme have unique keys value and transformation formulas. This means that transformation data have original data attributes at all times. Therefore, PTS can be used to share location data by grouping different transformation data among authorized users. The simulation results show that PTS is a faster and more secure scheme for real-time processing systems than conventional schemes.},

abstract={The NATO Object Level Protection (OLP) is an approach to Allied data protection that aims to protect individual information objects separately. OLP has an evolution stage which involves the direct use of cryptography in this context, called Cryptographic Access Control. Using next-generation public-key encryption techniques called attribute-based encryption (ABE), RBAC policies may be directly encoded into encrypted objects and their respective key material. While attractive in theory, there is only little research on the performance impact of using different ABE solutions to determine their applicability in variety of military situations, for example tactical setups and military evolution stages of Internet-of-Things. Additionally, many of the early ABE schemes are lacking in their security model. Later schemes remedy these models, but with an additional impact in performance. In this paper, we will investigate the performance impact of using ABE with real-life military policies in the OLP context, both with proposed basic security model (selective security) ABE and newer full security ABE schemes. The investigation is performed by experimenting with existing ABE software libraries, such as PBC and Charm. We present both relative and absolute measures of bandwidth and computational performance of two, OLP-compatible ABE schemes.},

abstract={In this paper, we describe the design and creation of four publicly available datasets generated using a testbed with simulated benign users and a manual attacker. The datasets were created to provide examples of cyber exploitations and aid in the production of reproducible research that address cyber security challenges. The CyberVAN testbed provides sophisticated capabilities for high-fidelity cyber experimentation in strategic and tactical network environments. The representative network is sufficiently complex with synthetic users performing normal duties that generate traffic (webpage browsing, e-mail, etc.). Both network and host based facts/logs are included in the dataset along with a diagram of the network and a timeline of events. The four datasets encompass progressively complex scenarios: 1) malware infection injection via a phishing email attachment; 2) propagating botnet injection via phishing email attachment with a Single Fast Flux algorithm for bot master identification/communication; 3) propagating botnet injection via email link using a Domain Generation Algorithm for bot master identification/communication; 4) propagating botnet injection via corruption of a legitimate internal web server with Double Fast Flux for bot master identification/communication. The full datasets along with relevant documentation is available for public download. Additional datasets containing tactical network scenarios and environments will be added to the repository in the future with the goal of enabling reproducible cyber security research that will advance the science of cyber security.},

pages={545-550}, 
abstract={The paper examines mobile TDMA-based ad hoc networks exposed to follower jamming. The focus is to examine how the terrain and network protocols influence jamming resistance. To study the network properties under follower jamming, network simulations are performed. The investigated networks in a flat terrain become more jammed than the corresponding networks in a hilly terrain. The packet delivery ratio is measured when the network protocol OLSR MPR-flooding is used and compared with a network using full flooding. Even if not as robust as full flooding, we show that OLSR MPR-flooding is still relatively robust. We also show that it is sufficient to jam the OLSR control traffic used by the network protocol to have a serious impact on the packet delivery ratio.},

pages={551-556}, 
abstract={We address a robust beamforming design and power allocation problem for a multi-pair one-way relay network, where the single-antenna users of each pair implement communication via a decode-and-forward multi-antenna relay. In this network, a secure user and other unclassified users coexist with a multi-antenna eavesdropper, and only the imperfect eavesdropper's channel state information (ECSI) is available. We aim to maximize the worst-case secrecy rate of the secure user while guaranteeing the quality of service of the unclassified users with a total power constraint. Motivated by this challenge, we explore the beamforming design and power allocation among the sources and the relay with the channel matrix error. Unfortunately, the proposed design constitutes a non-convex problem, which involves an infinite number of constraints because of the imperfect ECSI. To this end, we propose an efficient algorithm by using the techniques of semidefinite relaxation, successive convex approximation and S-procedure techniques. Following a similar optimization framework, we further investigate the scheme with the channel covariance matrix error. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

pages={557-562}, 
abstract={In certain forensic or military investigations, it may be of interest to monitor an unknown network. When doing such, it may be difficult to discern packet payloads from the encapsulation layers of the protocols being implemented. The network protocols used may not be standard, thus it can be challenging to de-encapsulate the layers to determine the locations of the packet payloads. Starting with the implementation of a hidden Markov model we identify key bifurcations in a non-time-stamped capture of packets. We then distinguish common lengths between bifurcations to find the locations of similarly structured data segments. Subsequently, we perform a cross-covariance of a small data segment over the entire dataset. Repeating this cross-covariance process with various segments we identify the locations of similar structures, which are likely to be packet headers. Where there is a strong cross-covariance we remove the bytes, leaving only the packet payloads. Through this series of relatively simple processes we are able to identify the headers within a small margin of error.},

title={On the robustness of the OLSR protocol under unwanted interference}, 
year={2016}, 
volume={},

pages={563-568}, 
abstract={Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) is a popular protocol for proactively establishing peer-to-peer links in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Protocol `hello' messages between neighbouring nodes establish link connections that are used to route information from a source via multiple relays to ultimately reach destinations that would not otherwise be directly connected to that source. The `hello' messages are sent periodically with a random timing jitter in order to avoid collisions with messages of other neighbouring nodes such that the connection integrity of the MANET, and thus network availability, remain high. In this paper we explore the robustness of the OLSR protocol under unwanted interference that causes a denial of service. We simulate the denial of service with a statistical method, targeting the `hello' messages with unwanted interference, and measure the mean time between failure and percent `connectedness' of a network link. Our results show that the commercial off-the-shelf implementations of the OLSR protocol are not resilient to unwanted interference leading a MANET to potential denial or degradation if its routing protocol were targeted. We conclude that a randomized jitter in OLSR `hello' message periodicity is an important element in avoiding this unwanted interference.},

pages={569-575}, 
abstract={Mobile social networks (MSNs) are modern paradigms of delay tolerant networks, which exploit human mobility and consequent wireless contacts between mobile devices to share information in a peer-to-peer manner. Since routing in MSNs depends heavily on the cooperation among participating nodes, selfish or malicious behaviors of nodes impact strongly on the routing performance. In this paper, we introduce the social relationship evaluation method (SRM) for detecting the quality of human social relationship and propose the trustworthy behavior evaluation method (TBM) which exploits recommendations from close friends to detect node's selfish or malicious behaviors. Based on SRM, we define the community of each node as the set of nodes having close social relationships with this node either directly or indirectly, and define the local community centrality to identify influential nodes for message forwarding in the community. Then, we propose SSRS, a novel social-based secure routing strategy, which exploits social relationships to enhance routing security and performance. Simulations have been conducted on the real world data set and results demonstrate that SSRS achieves better performances than the existing algorithms.},

abstract={This paper presents a working model of conversational adjacency graphs (CAGs), both temporal and non-temporal, useful in analyzing interactive communication patterns amongst distributed network actors. The paper utilizes Shakespeare's Hamlet as a baseline reference model to outline the construction of representative weighted graph models of inter-actor conversations, both temporal and non-temporal. A sampling of related complex network analytic metrics both temporal and non-temporal variants is also presented on the respective graph models. We discuss a related experiment carried out in which network exchanges amongst distributed actor nodes are orchestrated within an emulated virtual wireless network scenario. A blind construction of the representative CAG is presented from received traffic logs without a-prior knowledge of the play ordering. In this case, source identification and reception ordering are the sole pieces of information used to estimate conversational adjacency relationships. We demonstrate that the example “blind” CAG construction from the empirically-measured model appears to reasonable match the baseline conversation graph model developed with a-priori information directly from play script. Issues and related ongoing work is discussed regarding the related analytics and potential applications of such models.},

Over the last few years, deep learning has had unprecedented success in areas such as image classification, speech recognition, etc. However, research on the use of deep learning to network or graph analysis is limited. We present three preliminary techniques that we have developed as part of the ARL Network Science CTA program: (a) unsupervised classification using a very highly trained image recognizer, namely Caffe; (b) supervised classification using a variant of convolutional neural networks on node features such as degree and assortativity; and (c) a framework called node2vec for learning representations of nodes in a network using a mapping to natural language processing.},

pages={594-599}, 
abstract={In the practical Disconnected, Intermittent, and Limited-bandwidth (DIL) network environment at the tactical edge, warfighters have to be able to efficiently transmit data between each other to ensure rapid situational response to the surrounding environment. To tackle with the intermittent wireless network connectivity in the DIL environment, the “carry-and-forward” approach has been adopted to exploit warfighters' mobility and physically relay the data upon contacts with each other, but its performance relies on accurate prediction of warfighters' contacts with each other. In this paper, we present a novel probabilistic framework that is able to ensure accurate prediction of warfighters' contacts by considering both initial deployment information and in-situ contact patterns of warfighters at the tactical edge. Analytically models are developed to depict the characteristics of both aspects and are then integrated towards a Bayesian-based probabilistic inference framework. Evaluation results over practical DIL network traces show that our approach can dramatically increase the accuracy of contact prediction and further improve the performance of data forwarding in the DIL network environment at the tactical edge.},

pages={600-605}, 
abstract={Classifying an edge or a node within a network graph according to its bridging characteristics is an important structural measure that has many practical analytic applications. Bridging centrality is a relatively new graph-based centrality metric for classifying nodes serving as key structural connections between dense components. A global bridging centrality has been previously introduced and requires global knowledge of the entire graph structure to perform the centrality computation. Recently, a local bridging centrality variant was also introduced that can be calculated locally requiring only limited local neighborhood graph information. We introduce an extended model of the recently introduced local bridging centrality based upon the the concept of a local “friends of friends” or 2-hop neighbor distance egocentric graph. We further develop and analyze the use of this extended centrality with both unweighted and weighted graph structures. Finally we present a series of comparative studies using a variety of graph models and examine ranking correlation comparisons with global bridging centrality results. Our analysis includes comparisons with both past literature models and newer temporal graph results of a 100-node mobile wireless network scenario with link weights representing dynamic reception quality.},

abstract={Disseminating content to a given subset of nodes in a network in a cost-effective manner is a fundamental problem in networks, and is referred to as multicast. If reaching all the nodes in the set is not necessary and reaching a quorum of size k within the set is sufficient, then the problem is referred to as k-anycast or any-k-cast. This has applications in a wide range of networks, e.g., function computation in spatial wireless networks such as sensor networks and influence flow in social networks. Since the k-anycast optimization problem is NP-complete, we propose two heuristic algorithms to address the problem: the first is based on greedy growth from the root node and the second is based on pruning from a larger multicast tree. We perform a comparative numerical study of their performance tradeoffs for a social collaboration network and a spatial network by evaluating the effect of terminal node distributions on the cost and exploration overhead of the k-anycast tree for different regimes of k for each network.},

The increase in jamming resistance of SOTM terminals using single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) transmission (with respect to the spectral efficiency) is compared to single-input-single-output (SISO) transmissions. The analysis demonstrates that using multiple adjacent beams at the satellite for antenna diversity in uplink, or combining signals from multiple mobile ground stations significantly improves the resistance against jamming for a given spectral efficiency.},

In this paper, we extend previous work on computational ferrying, where Mobile High Performance Computers (MHPCs) physically move the necessary hardware into the proximity of mobile devices. Our extension proposes several improvements: 1) Path planning, which is used for reliable a priori estimation of distances between locations, yielding more accurate scheduling; 2) Collision checking, which permits robots to carry out the role of MHPCs; and 3) Prioritization, allowing operators to assign weights to tasks.

If any disconnection occurs due to a unit going out of the visibility polygons of all the vehicles, we propose a solution to repair it by dispatching a single vehicle that is optimal in terms of visibility and relocation cost. We tested our ideas through computer simulations in several case studies based on different mobility models.},

abstract={In VLF/LF communication systems, atmospheric noise is the dominant interference, which is usually highly impulsive and can be effectively modeled as symmetric α-stable (SαS) distribution. It has been known that communication techniques designed under Gaussian noise assumption always have poor performance under impulsive noise. In this work, we focus on the detection problem of minimum shift keying (MSK) signals under SαS noise, because this modulation is widely used in VLF/LF communication systems. As SαS distribution usually has no closed form probability density function (PDF), the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) based detection of MSK signals is hard to implement. To address this problem, we proposed a closed form approximation of the branch metric used in the Viterbi algorithm (VA) for MSK coherent detection, and provided a closed form approximation of the local optimal MSK non-coherent detection. Compared with ML based algorithms, the proposed algorithms have closed form and are simple to implement. Simulation results show that the bit error ratio (BER) performance of the proposed MSK coherent detector can closely approach that of the ML based coherent detector. Meanwhile, the proposed MSK non-coherent detector can attain the similar BER performance as that of the ML based non-coherent detector in low signal-to-noise ratio region.},

abstract={Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling is a potential technique to improve spectral efficiency without reducing the bit error rate (BER) performance, but the severe inter-symbol interference (ISI) induced by it may lead to intolerable complexity of maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD). An effective method of FTN detection is frequency domain iterative block decision feedback equalizer (IBDFE), as it can achieve performance close to MLSD with much lower complexity. Based on the structure of IBDFE, this paper proposes a reduced-complexity IBDFE (RC-IBDFE) for FTN communication systems. Since a simplified method is employed to design the feedforward and feedback filters, RC-IBDFE further reduces the complexity of FTN detection. Numerical results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed RC-IBDFE has similar BER performance to IBDFE with much stronger robustness and lower complexity.},

abstract={The Median of Maxima Estimate (MOME) receiver is a distribution-free Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) receiver used to detect signal bursts against a time-varying, non-Gaussian background. Receiver configuration requires selecting four parameters that determine detection performance and adaptation rate. A semi-analytic method of determining the false alarm rate is proposed. This procedure avoids time consuming simulations to find the false alarm rate when comparing receiver configurations. It also significantly reduces the parameter search space for finding detection probability. An example worked using this technique shows that good detector performance and rapid adaptation are both available with properly selected detector parameters.},

abstract={We propose a technique for low-data rate (~ 100 kb/s) millimeter-wave radio communications for applications involving large numbers of users in severe interference environments. The essential principle is to divide large bandwidths into channels having bandwidths which are individually orders of magnitude greater than the message bit rate, apply a direct sequence spread spectrum carrier to each channel, and represent information as time offsets between channels. Among other benefits, this approach is intrinsically robust to multipath fading and delay spread, is intrinsically robust to interference, and is well-suited for low-size/weight/power/cost implementation. In this paper we describe the technique, analyze performance, and describe a simple hardware implementation.},

abstract={Spread spectrum communication systems can require significant computation to perform initial acquisition, searching across time and frequency to accurately detect and lock onto the desired signal. This initial acquisition problem is exacerbated in deeply spread non-binary signals lacking cyclostationary features or repetitive codes, leading to a desire for less computationally intensive approaches. This paper introduces adaptive correlation methods that employ iterative Bayesian estimation techniques to reduce the expected computational load of signal acquisition, yet still achieve desired detection probabilities. Improvements to the adaptive correlator technique are identified, permitting flexibility in the correlation search windows, making it configurable for different applications like GNSS, DSSS communications, and noise-like chaotic spread spectrum signals. This paper presents analytical predictions of adaptive correlator performance, validated by measured FPGA hardware results achieving savings of 80% over brute-force serial time-domain acquisition searches.},

abstract={A two-path model, where each path includes a linear Doppler frequency offset, is commonly applied for modeling aeronautical channels under an en-route scenario. In this study, a maximum-likelihood (ML) channel estimation-based channel response differential correlation method is used to estimate a bilinear Doppler frequency offset. Specifically, reference symbols and ML estimation are used to obtain the channel response and to separate the two paths. Then, for each path, the ML frequency offset estimation is performed via a differential correlation operation. In the absence of interference, ordinary least square (LS) channel estimation and ML channel estimation demonstrate similar performance in frequency offset estimation, but the accuracy of LS channel estimation decreases dramatically in the presence of narrow-band interference, whereas ML channel estimation continues to demonstrate good accuracy, even under strong narrow-band interference, indicating high robustness. We also present a frequency offset compensation method for a two-path channel based on obtaining a maximum signal to interference ratio. The performance of the proposed methods for frequency offset estimation and compensation are validated via simulation.},

abstract={Waveforms proposed for future communication systems aim at fulfilling the demanding requirements of the next generation of 5G applications. In this paper, an enhancement over Zero Tail Discrete Fourier Transform Spread Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (ZT DFT-S-OFDM) is proposed. The presented Zero Tail Filter Bank Spread OFDM (ZT FB-S-OFDM) replaces the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) block with a filter bank (FB) block. The performance of the conventional system is degraded due to the non-perfect zero-tails. The proposed system suppresses the power over the zero-tails by using raised cosine (RC) shaped pulses near the zero-tails. An implementation scheme for the transmitter and the receiver is proposed. It is shown that suppressing the power over the zero-tail enhances the system bit error rate (BER) performance. Furthermore, results show extra improvements in the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and out-of-band emission (OOBE) performances.},

abstract={A prime objective in tactical environments is reliable, ad hoc communication among multiple users robust to lapses in coordination methods such as GPS or centralized base stations. Classical approaches to multi-user communications relying on tight node synchronization and/or power control are infeasible in ad hoc infrastructure-poor scenarios. In this paper, we study multi-user coding strategies with greatly reduced synchronization requirements (compared to conventional systems such as cellular) ideally suited for mobile near-ground nodes in harsh tactical environments. We exploit quasi-synchronous (QS) direct sequence (DS) code division multiple access (CDMA) codes transmitted over multiple carriers (MC). These codes are characterized by a zero cross-correlation zone (ZCZ), a measure of the delay tolerance among transmitters over which perfect code orthogonality still holds at the receiver. Using multiple carriers extends the ZCZ in time, thereby relaxing the time synchronization requirement, but tightening the frequency synchronization requirement. We study this tradeoff in this paper. We also argue that the QS MC-DS-CDMA system will have superior performance at lower VHF because of reduced multipath, reduced frequency offset, and better penetration relative to UHF or microwave systems in dense urban environments [1]-[4]. We develop an experimental testbed based on software-defined radios (SDR) and analyze the proposed approach at the lower VHF band.},

The bed elevation and basal conditions of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are important to numerical modeling of these ice sheets, but it's difficult to collect data over these large ice sheets with airborne radars to generate a high resolution bed map. Furthermore, processing with a large number of data sets would be a major problem. Based on the existing interpolation approaches, a simple nearest neighbor estimation method is introduced in this work. In addition, we improve the gradient projection for sparse reconstruction (GPSR) algorithm with co-prime up-sampling and test it on the Greenland bed elevation raw data set. The simulation results show that the new approach not only reduces the estimation error in reconstruction process, but also improves the resolution dramatically in comparison with compressive sensing algorithm.},

abstract={To support the flexibility and the different protocol operations and applications provided by today's internet, modern routers rely on high-performance reliable general-purpose multi-core packet processing systems. Such processing systems are programmable and have replaced the traditional fixed-logic hardware in the data path of such routers. This programmability introduces a lot of vulnerabilities and faults which make such systems susceptible to attacks and failures. Particularly, it is a difficult task to detect whether a processing core behaves correctly or it has a failure resulting from errors or attacks. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel approach to verify the correct operation of the network processor. We propose a secure, fault tolerant and reliable monitoring subsystem which functions in parallel with the processing core of the router and aids in the detection of attacks. We show that our system has the ability to detect the failure and restore securely the router's operation to a different, but functionally equivalent state.},

abstract={Network-based moving target defense systems are a valuable addition to the world of computer security and privacy. Ongoing research attempts to push the boundaries of network-based moving target defenses by adding client/server functionality to the Moving Target IPv6 Defense (MT6D) system. While this additional functionality provides a great many benefits, it is important to fully understand the impact to the network of implementing an MT6D server, which by definition greatly increases the amount of management traffic on a network segment. IPv6 relies on the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) for all network management functions, including the discovery of currently active addresses. Each address that is bound requires a number of NDP messages to be exchanged before a host can begin using said address. When an MT6D server requires the binding of a large number of IPv6 addresses to a single interface, there is likely to be some negative impact to the network due to the amount of NDP traffic that is generated.

abstract={In this paper we consider the problem of sensor-level packet loss (SLPL) as it applies to network intrusion detection. We explore 2 research questions: 1) Is there sufficient regularity in SLPL to allow an algorithm to be developed to model it? and 2) Is the impact of SLPL on network intrusion detection performance sufficiently regular to allow a formula to be developed that will accurately predict the effect? We developed and validated the Pcapreplay program, which allowed us to characterize the manifestation of SLPL. We conducted experiments using Pcapreplay and Snort to explore the impact of SLPL.We graphed and analyzed this impact against our previous theoretical work. We conducted experiments using Pcapreplay and Snort to measure the impact on network intrusion detection. We graphed the alert loss rate against the packet loss rate. We compared these graphs to our previous theoretical work. We used nonlinear regression analysis to produce a formula with r-squared and reduced adjusted r-squared values close enough to 1 for us to answer both of our research questions in the affirmative.},

abstract={This paper discusses the use of an ontology to characterize network behavior features. Efficient and timely threat detection requires careful examination of network packets as well as integration of observed packet level behaviors into a coherent view of the network. We focus on a method to capture the semantic properties of packet transmission at different levels of granularity, making the case for using modular ontologies as a tool to capture and integrate behaviors for threat detection. This study extends the existing work on ontologies of cyber security, embracing a holistic approach and providing a well-grounded modular representation of network behaviors. We demonstrate how beaconing behavior is represented using a vocabulary of network behavior features. Then, we show how this approach can be used to detect malware beaconing to a command-and-control server. Further implications and extensions are discussed in the context of network intrusion and cyber security.},

abstract={Moving Target Defense (MTD) is based on the notion of controlling change across various system attributes with the objective of increasing uncertainty and complexity for attackers; the promise of MTD is that this increased uncertainty and complexity will increase the costs of attack efforts and thus prevent or limit network intrusions. As MTD increases complexity of the system for the attacker, the MTD also increases complexity and cost in the desired operation of the system. This introduced complexity may result in more difficult network troubleshooting and cause network degradation or longer network outages, and may not provide an adequate defense against an adversary in the end. In this work, the authors continue MTD assessment and evaluation, this time focusing on application performance monitoring (APM) under the umbrella of Defensive Work Factors, as well as the empirical assessment of a network-based MTD under Red Team (RT) attack. APM provides the impact of the MTD from the perspective of the user, whilst the RT element provides a means to test the defense under a series of attack steps based on the LM Cyber Kill Chain.},

year={2016}, 
volume={},

pages={770-775}, 
abstract={Typosquatting becomes a speculative and serious phenomenon for both Internet users and brand owners of popular websites. Typosquatters register similar domain names of popular websites to profit from displaying advertisements, redirecting traffic to third-party pages, deploying phishing sites, or serving malware. Thus, much work have been done on measuring typosquatting in distribution, monetization and cost etc. This paper does not measure typosquatting, but tries to combat typosquatting abuse from the abnormal detection view: a domain that looks very much like one popular website is suspicious. We propose TypoPegging, a reverse lookup approach to quickly and accurately get the most similar popular website for a given domain. Specifically, we propose a novel quantitative method to measure the visual similarity of two given domains. The proposed method is based on generalized Levenshtein distance that takes insights of our novel visual characteristics. Then we give an efficient method to search the maximum visual similarity of a domain over a given popular website set. We accelerate the searching process based on the triangle inequality of our visual distance metric and the locality sensitive hashing algorithm. Preliminary results show that our work is effective in differentiating typosquatting domain names from normal ones. We can also speedup the searching process in orders of magnitude comparing with the linear searching method.},

abstract={Performance assessment of human teaming in complex, real-world contexts is a fundamental challenge for research and training communities alike. We highlight a unique partnership between the cybersecurity training and research communities with the common goal of capturing human team performance. Whether in the context of a training assessment or a research endeavor; both are two sides of the same coin. As cybersecurity training events and competitions have evolved, there is increasing interest in analyzing the performance of the defenders as well as identifying the best methods of training, assessing, and educating the cybersecurity workforce. This includes analysis of the types of training, pedagogy, and the relationship between education, training, and commercial Information Technology (IT) certifications. In this work, we present a high-level look along with some initial findings from the premiere cyber training event for the Army National Guard Bureau focused on enhancing the capabilities of cyber defense teams to mitigate threats to critical national infrastructure. Our first year data collection effort was conducted in the spring of 2015 and involved multiple threads of data collection. The main realization to come from this study is that improved systems and procedures should be put in place to effectively monitor and quantify team behavior for valid analyses. As the research and training partnership matures, we hope to significantly improve the data collection and assessment of human team performance in follow-on exercises.},

abstract={The importance of correlation analysis between cyber threat incidents using Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) from multiple sources is growing for the enhanced international collaboration on cyber threats. Well-analyzed CTI can increase capabilities to deter possible cyber threats. To this end, many standards have been proposed for efficient CTI expression and sharing to increase attack tractability and to prevent future cyber threats. Even though the standards are proposed, the lack of analysis methodologies reduces the usability of CTI. To overcome this limitation, we propose a general framework to support the efficient correlation analysis of cyber threat incidents using CTI. In the framework, related events are represented by the tree structure named Event Relation Tree (ERT), and the temporal transition of the event characteristics is expressed by Event Transition Graph (ETG). Through the case studies on our CTI dataset, we show the usefulness of ERT and ETG for the correlation analysis.},

Empirically, we learn chunks and structures based on their frequencies from the numerical passwords of leaked corpus, and model them with probabilistic context-free grammars to generate password guesses. Experiment results on the leaked Chinese password corpus included 24 million entries show that our approach achieves 46.91% relative gains over word lists approach, and 31.07% relative gains in the first 1 million guesses than John the Ripper (JtR), and 50.76% relative gains for guessing long numerical password than JtR.},

That is, a host's view of its network, including subnet topology and IP address assignments of reachable hosts and servers, does not reflect physical network configurations and is different than the view of any other host in the network. ACyDS generates network views with the desired properties dynamically; it also changes every host's network view on-the-fly. ACyDS's deception approach (i) deters reconnaissance if an intruder has compromised a host in the network, (ii) prevents collusion if multiple hosts have been compromised, and (iii) increases the likelihood and confidence of detecting the presence of intruders.},

abstract={In mission critical networks, nodes need to communicate with minimum delay and loss. This calls for routing protocols that can quickly and efficiently route the application traffic to their destinations. This paper proposes a distance-based routing protocol, named as Smallworld, which finds efficient routes to target nodes often through a very short chain of intermediate nodes, without using any routing table like other standard routing protocols. This protocol exploits the “small-world” phenomenon of social networks where source-destination pairs typically get connected through few intermediate friends and the individuals can collectively discover such short paths. The key idea behind this routing protocol is that for forwarding an incoming packet to the destination, a node picks the next hop from between a one-hop neighbor, from its one-hop neighborhood that is closest to the destination, and a randomly selected long-distance neighbor, i.e., from outside of its one-hop neighborhood, based on which of these two neighbors is closer to the destination. This simple but effective algorithm can meet mission performance objectives by reducing packet losses, end-to-end delays, hop-counts, connectivity drops and control overheads in many tactical scenarios of interest.},

abstract={New generation radio equipment, used by soldiers and vehicles on the battlefield, constitute ad hoc networks and specifically, Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANET). The battlefield where these equipment are deployed includes a majority of coalition communication. Each group on the battleground may communicate with other members of the coalition and establish inter-MANETs links. Operational communications tend to provide tactical ad hoc networks some capacities. There is a better broadband radio in UHF band (ex: NATO - 225-400 MHz) and some heterogeneous services such as voice or video (ex: capture from a drone) are provided. Several Network-layer protocols have been proposed in order to handle inter-domain routing for tactical MANETs. In this paper, we present a coalition context and describe the functional hypothesis we used. Then, we propose a protocol that would fit such a network and conduct experimentation that tend to show that our proposition is quite efficient.},

Because of its versatility, Tactical Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork (MANET) is also widely used by modern military units especially for the autonomous maneuvering of unmanned vehicles and robots.

The resource allocation scheme of MAC layer and load balancing of network layer can be critical factors in Tactical MANET. Without a QoS scheme, users might have difficulties in getting their service in Tactical MANET.

abstract={Modern battlefields are characterized by increasing deployment of ad hoc communications among allied entities. These networks can be seen as a complex multi-layer ad hoc network, where each layer may be an independently acting soldiers' group, a group of drones, helicopters, vehicles and so on. Building a backbone network for these environments, which will guarantee efficient communication among all nodes (i.e., network-wide broadcasting) is of fundamental significance for the dissemination of information. In this article we generalize the concept of connected dominating sets for multi-layer networks and use them as the network backbone. We propose efficient methods to identify nodes that are efficient cross-layer spreaders along with a distributed algorithm to build the connected dominating set. Due to the lack of competing methods in the literature, we compare the proposed methods against some baseline methods and investigate the performance of all algorithms for a variety of multi-layer network topologies, illustrating their advantages and disadvantages; the result of the evaluation identifies the clPCI method of recognizing efficient cross-layer spreaders as the champion method.},

abstract={The relay node placement problem in the wireless sensor network have been studied extensively in the last few years. The goal of most of these problems is to place the fewest number of relay nodes in the deployment area so that the network formed by the sensors nodes and the relay nodes is connected. Most of these studies are conducted for the unconstrained budget scenario, in the sense that there is an underlying assumption that no matter however many relay nodes are needed to make the network connected, they can be procured and deployed. However, in a fixed budget scenario, the expenses involved in procuring the minimum number of relay nodes to make the network connected may exceed the budget. Although in this scenario, one has to give up the idea of having a network connecting all the sensor nodes, one would still like to have a network with high level of “connectedness”. In the paper we introduce two metrics for measuring “connectedness” of a disconnected graph and study the problem whose goal is to design a network with maximal “connectedness”, subject to a fixed budget constraint. We show that both versions of the problem are NP-complete and provide heuristics for their solution. We show that the problem is non-trivial even when the number of sensor nodes is as few as three. We evaluate the performance of heuristics through simulation.},

abstract={On modern military platforms, there are many electronic systems that can cause interference to other. In order to mitigate the performance degradation this cosite interference might cause, attenuation of the received power from the interference sources is needed. In this work, we propose simple methods to select appropriate attenuation values for multiple impulse noise sources. The methods are based on approximations of the total bit error probability (BEP), in order to determine the impact from each individual source on the total system performance. Different methods for approximating the resulting BEP, and thereafter selecting the appropriate attenuations, are proposed based on different levels of knowledge of the individual interference signals.

abstract={The recent increase in commercial availability of Remote Control Aircraft (RCA) has created numerous security and privacy concerns for the general public. In particular, RCAs jeopardize public safety in the already crowded airspace surrounding many large airports. An approach for protection from illegally operated RCAs is to utilize smart jamming methodologies against the frequency hopping radios commonly used in these applications. However, the abundance of radio manufacturers, along with their often closed or proprietary physical layer protocols, challenges existing smart jamming schemes. In this paper we propose a method to automatically synchronize in time and frequency with a frequency hopping radio at the physical layer by modelling the radio as a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Our approach automates the determination of hop rates, hop frequencies, and timing of the target radio. We present multiple algorithms for identifying key HMM parameters and compare these algorithms using simulated data. We present the results of our HMM approach as we vary simulated noisy channel characteristics.},

abstract={By sharing hardware resources, integrated radarcommunication systems can effectively solve issues of high cost, complicated electromagnetic environment, and inefficient information processing, which the traditional systems with individual radar and communication models suffer from. For integrated radar-communication systems, accurate channel estimation is essential to guarantee the system performance, while few literature has addressed this issue. In this paper, based on integration mode of time division multiplex, we propose a compressive sensing (CS)-based virtual angular domain channel estimation scheme for phased array radar based integrated radar-communication systems, whereby the spatial channel sparsity is leveraged for the enhanced performance. Specifically, we elaborate a sequence of pre-defined beamforming vectors at the transmitter to probe the channel. At the receiver, we formulate channel estimation as a sparse signal recovery problem, where the sparsity adaptive matching pursuit (SAMP) algorithm is used to solve this problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can effectively solve the channel estimation problem in the integrated radar-communication system with much reduced complexity, and outperforms the conventional least square (LS) estimator by 4dB~5dB when channel estimation mean square error (MSE) performance is considered.},

abstract={Inspired by the success of multi-carrier waveforms such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) in radio communication, multi-carrier based radar waveform designs have gained strong interest recently. Reasons for this include their resistance to multipath fading, ability to overcome the limitations of a congested frequency spectrum, ability to exploit frequency diversity gains, and potential to perform radar and communication functions simultaneously within the same hardware using the same waveform. This paper provides recent research on multi-carrier waveform design for joint radar and communication systems. First, we employ OFDM to modulate Multi-Frequency Complementary Phase Coded (MCPC) sequences in order to improve radar range resolution performance. Next, it is shown that even though these MCPC sequences produce periodic autocorrelation sidelobes with deep nulls, their overall sidelobe level is higher than that of other traditional pulse-compression radar waveforms such as Linear Frequency Modulated (LFM) waveforms. A method, termed Polar Signal Detection, is introduced as a means of overcoming these large autocorrelation sidelobes without sacrificing range measurement resolution.},

abstract={As electromagnetic spectrum availability shrinks, there is growing interest in combining multiple functions, such as radar and communications signals, into a single multipurpose waveform. Historically mixed-modulation has used orthogonal separation of different message signals in different dimensions such as time or frequency. This research explores an alternative approach of implementing an in-band, mixed-modulated waveform that combines surveillance radar and communication functions into a single signal. The contribution of this research is the use of reduced phase-angle binary phase shift keying (BPSK) along with overlapped (channelized) spread-spectrum phase discretes based on pseudorandom noise sequences to encode multiple messages in a single pulse. The resulting mixed-modualted signal provides a low data rate communications message while minimizing the effect on radar performance. For the purpose of this research, radar performance will be evaluated in terms of power spectral density, matched filter auto-correlation for target detection, and the ambiguity function.},

abstract={It is well-known that the use of stretch processing of FMCW pulses in multitarget scenarios results in the detection of false targets. The problem arises from the delay-Doppler coupling where the beat frequency cannot be attributed to a unique delay-Doppler pair. There have been many proposed waveform designs that attempt to resolve this ambiguity, however, the problem is aggravated as the number of targets grows. Existing approaches for multitarget detection use waveforms of limited configurability, such as up-down chirps separated by CW segments for measuring Doppler. In this paper, we propose a chirp diversity pulse train waveform and the associated detector structure that isolates the returns that lie within one pulse interval. This separation reduces the number of combinations needed to solve for the targets. Furthermore, the waveform is tuned to resolve delay-Doppler coupling of multiple targets with no need for a separate CW segment often used to solve for Doppler. The coupling is resolved by the least squares fit of the beat frequencies to the most likely target delay-Doppler profiles.},

pages={942-947}, 
abstract={Position information is important for conducting battlefield missions. GPS generally enables allies to identify positions. RELNAV defined in Link-16 is used for JU in the air to estimate its position as an auxiliary navigation system of GPS. However, there is a critical problem in RELNAV. To operate accurately, RELNAV requires the presence of ground reference units that help to estimate the positions of JUs operated by RELNAV. However, guaranteeing the constant presence of ground reference units in a battlefield is difficult. If the presence of ground reference units is not assured, JUs operated by RELNAV have a critical problem in maintaining high positional quality. They depend on inertial navigation systems that can accumulate positional errors with time. In this environment, such errors will become large, and hence maintaining accurate operation of RELNAV is difficult. Therefore, we propose an alternative that can solve such problems. In the proposed scheme, we select new references that can play the role of GRU in RELNAV among allies conducting operations on the ground. The new references are responsible for estimating the positions of JUs. To do so optimally, a JU uses a reference selection algorithm that assures high quality of dilution of precision between the JU and the new references. Position errors of JUs decrease largely as a result of the presence of new references in the proposed scheme. RELNAV can therefore be conducted with higher positional accuracy of JUs than that of the existing RELNAV. We verify through some simulations that the feasibility and performance of the proposed scheme are better than those of the existing scheme.},

pages={952-957}, 
abstract={In this paper, a new code is constructed by concatenating a Golay complementary code pair (A, B) with a gap in between. The autocorrelation of this code contains a zero-sidelobe region on either side of the mainlobe and an adjacent region of small cross-correlation sidelobes. This is achieved by using a polyphase code pair as chips for A and B that satisfy two conditions: they have conjugate symmetry/anti-symmetry property and are quasi-orthogonal in the convolution sense. The conjugate symmetry/anti-symmetry property results in the zero-sidelobe region, while the quasi-orthogonality property makes the adjacent region of cross-correlation sidelobes small. The complementary code pair could also be interlaced in the time domain avoiding the above mentioned gap. However, the zero-sidelobes and the small cross-correlation sidelobes are also interlaced in its autocorrelation. Polyphase codes based on linear FM (LFM) and piecewise LFM (PLFM) waveforms are used as chips for the complementary code pair, since they satisfy both the conjugate symmetry/anti-symmetry and the quasi-orthogonality conditions. Any polyphase good code set that satisfies the conjugate symmetry/anti-symmetry condition could be used as chips with the same complementary code pair to generate a good code set with a zero-sidelobe region and an adjacent region of small cross-correlation sidelobes. Such sets are constructed using polyphase code sets based on LFM and PLFM waveforms as chips.},

abstract={In ongoing efforts, our team has developed DISCO (Distributed Cross-layer Architecture for Network Awareness and Opportunistic Transport), a cross-layer framework to enable network awareness and automated adaptation of transport, network and application parameters in a MANET. DISCO automates discovery of new applications and services, and applies rule-based logic and machine learning to enable the network to better meet application's performance requirements or for applications to adjust their requirements. DISCO also supports legacy applications using proxies to maintain backward compatibility. Our DISCO broker collects cross layer information, shares it in a distributed manner to guide new transport and network-layer adaptation methods. In this paper, we present an overview of DISCO and introduce a new TCP variant called TCP-Derwood-Lite that benefits from DISCO's design and provides performance comparable to the original TCP-Derwood. Unlike other TCP variants that operate on per packet microsecond timescales, Derwood-Lite operates on a per-second timescale in the user space, and still provides significant performance benefits in wireless networks with path or link switches. Our EMANE emulation experiments on engineering and tactical scenarios with as many as 23 mobile nodes in an OLSR MANET show 2X performance gains over TCP Reno and TCP Westwood, comparable to TCP Derwood but with much lower processing requirements.},

abstract={Disruption/Delay tolerant networking (DTN) is a promising solution to mitigate the effects of periodic link outages that last seconds to minutes, which are prevalent in high capacity airborne tactical networks that are directional in nature and highly affected by aircraft body blockage. There are several considerations for applying the DTN Bundle Protocol (RFC 5050) in tactical edge networks which have ciphertext/plaintext boundaries resulting in multiple deployment options: 1) black-side DTN tunnel, 2) red-side DTN interface, 3) red-side DTN proxy, and DTN-enabled applications. Each of these approaches have benefits and limitations. In this paper, we present a DTN proxy implementation that can work on both red or black sides of tactical edge networks and show test results that help us better understand the capability of the approach, its limitations, and in what circumstances it is most appropriate. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, we show that TCP file transfer speed can be increased by up to 143.39% and 218% for two-hop and three-hop aerial backbone networks respectively when each link suffers 25% independent outage.},

abstract={Tactical Edge Networks provide one of the most challenging communication environments. In order to cope with node mobility, constrained resources, and link unreliability, communication solutions designed for Tactical Edge Networks typically present highly configurable interfaces to be adaptable for various networking conditions. However, the extreme dynamicity and heterogeneity of tactical scenarios call for network-aware, adaptive communication systems that continuously re-tune their configuration parameters to match the ever-changing network conditions. This paper presents the Dynamic Detect and Adapt Mechanism (DDAM) of the Agile Communication Middleware, a distributed solution to perform network monitoring and communication adaptation specifically designed for Tactical Edge Networks. The present work focuses on two components of the DDAM: NetSensor, which provides efficient monitoring of the network status, and NetSupervisor, which is responsible for characterizing the network technology used to connect a pair of nodes in the network. The presented results show that our solution can accurately identify the technology used to establish links between nodes.},

abstract={Targeted attacks are a significant problem for governmental agencies and corporations. We propose a MinHash-based, targeted attack detection system which analyzes aggregated process creation events typically generated by human keyboard input. We start with a set of malicious process creation events, and their parameters, which are typically generated by an attacker remotely controlling computers on a network. The MinHash algorithm allows the system to efficiently process hundreds of millions of events each day. We propose the weighted squared match similarity score for targeted attack detection which is more robust to mimicry and NOOP attacks than the weighted Jaccard index. We demonstrate that the system can detect several confirmed targeted attacks on both a small dataset of 1,473 computers as well as a large network of over 230 thousand computers. In the first case, the proposed system detects a similar, but separate attack while in the latter, intrusion activity is detected at large-scale.},

Software patching is a complex and failure-prone process that, on enterprise networks, requires triage. Accurate inventories of software (applications and operating systems) improve patching efficiency, which is a significant concern for security analysts. By generating asset baselines, the SAA identifies and reports abnormal deviations in individual end-devices, which allows security analysts to identify vulnerable devices and further enforce security patching. This system is also suited for detecting vulnerable software installs and remediation process verification. SAA is a low-cost and efficient method that yields accurate and complete inventories of assets on end-devices, reducing the potential loss from new vulnerabilities.},

However, since security and reliability of RBAC are mostly depending on the quality of roles, how to find proper roles is a challenging problem. However, few existing approaches have taken abnormal configurations in the original data into consideration, these abnormal configurations always lead to wrong roles and thus cause tremendous security risks. To address this problem, we propose a novel role mining framework considering user similarities and abnormal configurations, simultaneously. Specifically, we propose a novel spectral clustering algorithm based on a newly designed similarity function. Then an abnormal configuration hunting method is proposed to target potential abnormal assignments and give recommendations to correct these configurations based on clustering results. Experimental results show its performance over existing solutions.},

While these graphs are powerful and widely used in enterprise network systems they focus on application vulnerabilities; they currently do not incorporate weaknesses in the network backbone (e.g., routing) that could lead to traffic hijacking, spoofing, eavesdropping, and several others.

pages={1016-1021}, 
abstract={A key property in tactical network environments is that the wireless network itself is typically the major limiting factor in how much information can be shared between users. In such environments, tactical operations often employ group communication protocols (one-to-many or many-to-many) to send information between users. This often results in situations where every message sent gets delivered to everyone on the network which can lead to network congestion, performance degradation, application failure, and even complete information loss. In light of today's computationally rich mobile devices, it is preferential to expend additional processing power to limit the messages being sent to only those required by interested clients rather than to simply deliver every message to every client. This paper summarizes the results of a research effort to explore and implement an Information Management (IM) prototype known as BANDIT that enables efficient and reliable information exchange across a swarm of Android devices within a decentralized Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network. BANDIT features a lightweight implementation of the Kademlia algorithm for P2P swarm management, and implements an efficient broadcast algorithm designed for minimal cost internode communication within structured P2P networks. BANDIT provides decentralized publish/subscribe IM services that, in contrast to more traditional IM systems, have no reliance on a centralized server (which requires additional dedicated hardware and poses the risk of being a single point of failure). Instead, BANDIT IM services are provided by each of the devices participating in the swarm. BANDIT is interoperable with traditional client-server based IM systems which further enables information sharing across tactical and strategic elements.},

abstract={Due to the lack of centralized coordination and time-varying network topologies, designing an efficient query processing scheme is admittedly challenging in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Each node often broadcasts a query, retrieves its queried data item, and periodically checks its freshness but a non-negligible communication overhead may incur. In tight of this, we propose a set of query processing strategies by deploying a validity region to efficiently minimise the query traffic and update the freshness of the queried data. We first investigate simple rectangle and convex hull based validity regions and their corresponding query processing schemes, and then extend them by adaptively combining both techniques and considering an opportunistic overhearing. We conduct extensive simulation experiments using the OMNYT++ simulation package for performance comparison and analysis, in which an infrastructure-based query processing approach is also adjusted to be implemented in MANETs. The simulation results indicate that our convex hull based adaptive query processing approaches can reduce the number of queries but it increases the time spent in the validity region.},

pages={1028-1033}, 
abstract={The software defined network (SDN) has emerged as an efficient network technology capable of supporting the dynamic nature of network functions while lowering the operating costs through simplified hardware, software, and management. The SDN is an efficient implementing technique for network function virtualization, because SDN maximizes network utilization by decoupling the wireless network infrastructure from the service that it provide, so that differentiated services can share the same infrastructure. One the other hand, information-centric network technique can reduce duplicate transmissions for popular contents by adopting caching strategy and enabling mobile-users to access popular contents from caches of nearby network gateways. One of the main challenges of implementing SDN is how to transmit the time-sensitive multimedia data with the delay-bounded quality of service (QoS) guaranteed in SDN environments. To overcome these difficulties, we propose an information-centric wireless network virtualization technique, which integrates the wireless network virtualization with information-centric networking. We formulate this data transmission problem over virtualized information-centric wireless network as follows. The mobile-user requests the data-source from the network controller. Network controller finds this data-source (located at the end host or a cache), and sets up a data delivery path for the mobile-user. We apply the effective capacity theory to measure the delay-bounded QoS for time-sensitive multimedia data transmission. The data delivery path is established based on a flexible network architecture, which can maximize the effective capacity, for the delivered data. In the delivery process, the data can be copied and stored in a network node as the cache for other mobile-users requests, aiming at minimizing the average transmit power consumption over all mobile-users.},

These types of applications typically require robust packet delivery and limited delays. Cooperative broadcasting is a promising technique to handle such requirements for broadcast traffic, especially in highly mobile networks. In this paper we propose an algorithm for dynamically assigning transmission rights in a cooperative broadcast framework. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified for a demanding traffic model using network simulations, in which the algorithm is compared to an algorithm without traffic adaptivity. The results show that the algorithm successfully handles demanding broadcast traffic scenarios with high capacity even under high mobility and in sparse networks.},

abstract={As the amount of mobile traffic carried over IP keeps increasing, the military networks face the scalability challenges of VoIP protocols. When the message arrival rate including retransmissions exceeds the message serving capacity of a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server, the queue size increases and eventually the SIP server can be crashed. In our previous studies, we proposed a priority based request scheduling mechanism (PRSM) to guarantee the survivability of SIP server under heavily loaded traffic conditions. In this paper, we introduce a fluid-flow analytical model to study the behavior of the overloaded SIP server with PRSM under various test scenarios. The experiments performed using both analysis and simulation tools indicate that the proposed model can accurately capture the dynamic behavior of a SIP server with the PRSM. The numerical results verify the effectiveness of the PRSM which provides consistently better scalability compared to the conventional SIP thus enable us to prevent server overload.},

abstract={The software defined networking is attracting significant attention from business and private end-users. With characteristic of virtualization and programmability, Service Providers (SPs) can pay for the resources in the term of virtual data centers (VDCs) to deploy their services without maintaining expertise. Despite advantages the new paradigm brings, offering VDCs as a service still faces a new challenge. It is the VDC embedding problem which is known as NP-hard. In this work we propose VDC embedding methods considering the tradeoff among multiple requirements, such as the reliability, revenue and bandwidth occupation. Our goal is to reduce resource occupation rate, increase the acceptance ratio of VDCs and improve the revenue for infrastructure providers (InPs). To reduce embedding cost and ensure the reliability requirement, our proposals try to group VMs with more traffic to a cluster based on topological potential and modularity and embed the VM clusters to distinct servers near to each other. Extensive simulations show that our proposed methods can embed more VDCs efficiently with higher resource utilization.},

This framework allows programmers to create new, extensible, and more powerful network applications at a much higher level of abstraction. As Pyretic does with POX, Ryuretic places an additional abstraction layer over the Ryu framework for network application development. Additionally, its abstractions allow researchers to target specific layers of the OSI model and install both proactive and reactive rule sets, without immersing themselves in the Ryu architecture.

The paper describes a SDN realization of AUV networking, and documents the implementation of a small-scale replica of the system in our testbed, which can be accessed remotely via a web page and SSH. We then demonstrate the functionality of our implementation by evaluating the performances of two existing MAC protocols namely Slotted FAMA [11] and UW-Aloha [13], in a multi-hop, underwater scenario.},

abstract={Cyber Situation Awareness (CSA) often requires the collaboration among a team of cyber analysts who work at different levels and/or different parts of the system. Each team member collects data such as intrusion alerts and network logs, generates his/her own awareness for the current cyber situation, and shares the awareness with other team members to generate the comprehensive understanding of the overall situation for the purpose of team decision-making. Since each team member may have his/her own personal expertise knowledge, experience, and opinions, it is difficult for the entire team to make consensus decision when having conflicting judgments on the types of cyber attacks. Furthermore, the complexity of cyber domain significantly exacerbates the situation awareness problems for the cyber analysts. Considering that human cyber analysts tend to use ambiguous linguistics to express their own cyber situation awareness during team collaboration, we propose a fuzzy set based method that allows cyber analysts to quantify their preference and reach consensus on the cyber attack types that are most acceptable by the entire team. Also, to facilitate collaboration among team cyber analysts across distances, we present a fuzzy sets based team CSA decision-making system to demonstrate how the proposed approach provides support for generating team CSA in a distributed manner with the ability of handling uncertain information.},

abstract={Real-time monitoring of physiological data can reduce the likelihood of injury in noncombat military personnel and first-responders. MIT Lincoln Laboratory is developing a tactical Real-Time Physiological Status Monitoring (RT-PSM) system architecture and reference implementation named OBAN (Open Body Area Network), the purpose of which is to provide an open, government-owned framework for integrating multiple wearable sensors and applications. The OBAN implementation accepts data from various sensors enabling calculation of physiological strain information which may be used by squad leaders or medics to assess the team's health and enhance safety and effectiveness of mission execution. Security in terms of measurement integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity is an area of interest because OBAN system components exchange sensitive data in contested environments. In this paper, we analyze potential cyber-security threats and their associated risks to a generalized version of the OBAN architecture and identify directions for future research. The threat analysis is intended to inform the development of secure RT-PSM architectures and implementations.},

abstract={Covert systems are designed to operate at a low probability of detection (LPD) in order to provide system protection at the physical layer level. The classical approach to covert communications hides the signal in noise; however, the increasing demand for modern covert systems that provides better protection against intercept receivers (IRs) has shifted the focus to the design of Ad-Hoc covert networks (ACNs) that can hide their transmission in the RF spectrum of primary networks (PNs), like mobile networks. In this paper, we use stochastic geometry to provide a comprehensive analysis for two covertness metrics, namely the aggregate metric and the ratio metric, which are used to quantify covertness from the perspective of the IR and the ACN, respectively. The metrics are used to determine the detectability limits of an ACN by an IR. We also demonstrate how the ratio metric can be used to estimate the average communication distance under certain covertness constraints. Additionally, we show how both metrics can be jointly used to analyze the design of the ACN.},

abstract={This paper examines the low-probability-of-exploitation (LPE) characteristics of a noncontiguous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (NC-OFDM) system. NC-OFDM transmission is similar to OFDM transmission but only uses a subset of the frequencies either to avoid incumbent transmissions or due to tactical considerations. This paper considers an NC-OFDM transmission with a given set of active subcarriers and examines how an eavesdropper can infer transmission parameters such as total duration of an NC-OFDM symbol, length of the cyclic prefix, etc., using tools like the cyclostationary analysis. Such an analysis reveals that difficulty in estimating the total nominal bandwidth of NC-OFDM transmissions (bandwidth that includes frequencies occupied by inactive subcarriers) poses a fundamental challenge in determining the correct sampling rate and the subsequent retrieval of the transmitted signal. The analysis also shows that the features of the cyclic autocorrelation function (CAF) of an NC-OFDM transmission depend closely on the set of active subcarriers. Procedures for inferring the transmission parameters from the CAF are discussed while noting that the choice of an interleaved set of subcarriers introduces additional ambiguity in determining the transmission parameters. A PCA-based offline timing recovery scheme is proposed and used as a guidepost in determining the minimum rate at which an active set of subcarriers must be refreshed to avoid easy exploitation. Finally, key advantages of an NC-OFDM system over an OFDM system from an LPE-standpoint are discussed and suggestions for an LPE-centric design of NC-OFDM systems are made.},

The main contributions of this paper are: 1) algorithm to generate uncorrelated channel measurements even when channel measurement statistics between the two terminals are time-varying; 2) development of a reconciliation algorithm based on BCH codes, where the statistics of error between bits generated by the two terminals is not known a priori; and 3) implementation of secret bit generation using channel reciprocity in a Linux environment.

In previous work, we identified the vast computational challenges of solving this problem when considering the effects of cumulative co-channel interference. We present a new method to solve this problem using heuristic, integer optimization, and constraint programming techniques. We apply our methods to realistic data sets from a large U.S. Marine Corps combat scenario, and provide detailed performance results.

abstract={To meet beyond line of sight (BLOS) communications requirements, a novel software defined radio relay method for power conservation is proposed. This method is able to achieve approximately 7.5 watt per relay node power savings for SNR challenged links (probability = 1/3), adjacent interference links (probability = 1/3), and 33% clear links (probability = 1/3). This is accomplished by dynamically adjusting the relay methodology between a low power amplify-and-forward (AF) relay method, a compress-and-forward (CF) relay method, and a power intensive decode-and-forward (DF) relay method. To demonstrate the novel architecture the following models were developed in MATLAB/Simulink and tested on an Avnet Zynq-7000 software defined radio (SDR) with Military RT 1439A radios: an audio FM transmitter model, an audio FM receiver model, an AF relay model, a CF relay model, a DF relay model, and the novel SDR relay model.},

abstract={Reliable and secure wireless communications is fundamental to connectivity between smarter gadgets and people. This is much more true in defence applications with its unique requirements and challenges. Broadly the data link requirements in defence applications are seen under two categories. One, robust fool-proof zero downtime data links for telemetry, command and control. Second, broad band data links for data streaming and high bandwidth information exchanges. The data link platforms offered for these applications must therefore address the need to quickly prototype waveforms, be easy for field and use-case tests, support quick means for security layer add-ons and easily be amenable to technology adoption, ruggedization and deployment. This paper describes some of the challenges of design and prototyping for defence applications and presents how agile systems built with the right choice of design partition and architecture choices with hardware, software and waveforms can be cognizant of the challenges of the defence applications and illustrates few example cases with simulations and real field deployment trials. It is envisaged that the Agile Cognizant Transceiver (ACT) platform built, helps faster prototyping of defence systems and paves the way for faster product induction cycles in defence automation.},

abstract={Since the near-far problem is expected to be a significant issue in the context of tactical communications, the tolerable amount of adjacent channel interference (ACI) is an important design requirement. We describe a numerical simulator which has been developed in order to evaluate the level of ACI arising in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) in the VHF band when a large number of nodes and radio networks must coexist. The simulator is based on a simplified system model and on an existing path loss model derived from channel measurements in different environments. Monte-Carlo simulations have been performed over a large number of independent static snapshots of the system and results have been compared to the performance of some binary continuous phase modulation (CPM) schemes. It turns out that the impact of ACI on the system is strongly dependent on the density of nodes within the operation scenario and the number of total available channels.},

abstract={In recent years, there has been a large push in the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to more rapidly respond and adapt to changing technology advancements and emerging threats. Nowhere is an accelerated pace of innovation more needed than in the airborne tactical domain where the predominant communication system, Link 16, has been in use for over 40 years. Airborne tactical systems are often stove-piped, highly integrated, and designed to be hardware-specific, making insertion of new technology at the component level extremely challenging. To resolve these limitations, DARPA has been exploring an architecture which separates the transceiver from the waveform processors from the application processors [1]. Each of these processors can be programmed with composable waveform blocks that can be chained together dynamically to leverage the available apertures to perform different missions from communications, SIGINT, electronic warfare, and others. As part of the effort, many of the current generation of airborne tactical waveforms were ported to the new architecture. In this paper, we describe some lessons learned in developing hardware-agnostic, composable, software communications blocks as a proof of concept of the modular new architecture.},

abstract={Joint Aerial Layered Network (JALN) could provide crucial communication links when milsatcoms are degraded or lost. A configuration problem arising is that how we can assign the antennas to JALN High Capacity Backbone (HCB) links to maximize the link availability where each JALN aircraft has four mounting points for directional antennas? The antenna assignment problem was first formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem, and a greedy approach was developed [1]. The goal of this work is to develop an efficient approach based on branch-and-bound method to find an optimal solution for the antenna assignment problem. The key to the success is that the problem-specific branch strategy can significantly reduce the optimization space by removing the redundant vertices that could not appear in the optimal solutions. Also, a better formulation of the antenna assignment problem reduces the constraint space by explicitly finding all maximal cliques in the conflict graph. Thus, the proposed efficient approach constructs a sequence of subproblems that monotonically converge to an optimal solution.},

abstract={This paper presents a force-level planning approach to optimally select and design the orbit of an airborne relay. The objective is to maximize the aggregate performance of communication subscribers served by the airborne relay. The performance is measured as either the duty cycle in terms of signal-to-noise-ratio or the throughput achieved by communication subscribers. Both measures are computed with realistic channel, terrain, antenna and aircraft characteristics for ground-to-air and air-to-ground communications. Different methods to generate an airborne relay orbit are discussed with their parameters to optimize. Results are specialized to optimization of elliptical orbit parameters. First, an elliptical orbit is optimally selected with the best center and radius (in X and Y-directions) as orbit parameters subject to the specified altitude and speed of the aircraft. Both exhaustive search and gradient search with reduced complexity are considered to find the best set of orbit parameters. This elliptical orbit is then converted to an operational orbit by optimally selecting orbit waypoints and locating smooth turning points while minimizing the fuel consumption of the airborne relay. A software with interactive GUI is designed and implemented for force-level planning that allows the planner to select different properties of airborne relay and communication subscribers, and returns the optimal orbit for the airborne relay.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to present a solution to reduce the Doppler effect in wireless communication systems. As distance increases, pathloss increases too and the signal to noise ratio decreases. A major problem that affects the quality of the link is the horizon. A solution to improve signal quality is to use an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) relaying far mobile stations to the base station. However, because of UAV's speed, Doppler frequency shift decreases the signal to noise ratio and cannot be supported by the base station for the values that are higher than the measured limit. The simple solution explained in this paper reduces dramatically the Doppler effect and makes possible the use of UAVs, as a repeater, to extend the communication even at high speed.},

abstract={We study secrecy communication for a multi-pair decode-and-forward (DF) relay network (MP-DFRN), where one of the singe-antenna sources is wiretapped by a single-antenna eavesdropper. In particular, we aim to maximize the secrecy rate of the secure source while guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) at the destinations with a total power constraint. The optimization requires a joint beamforming and power allocation at the multi-antenna relay, and this problem turns out to be non-convex. To this end, an efficient algorithm is proposed by using the techniques of successive convex approximation and constrained concave convex procedure. Following a similar optimization framework, we further investigate the transmit power minimization problem with secrecy and QoS constraints. Our study suggests a new and efficient framework to achieve secrecy communication in the MP-DFRN, and also reveals the interplay between the achievable secrecy rate and the total power budget.},

abstract={In this paper, we enhance the security of OFDM systems in frequency selective fading channels using signal space diversity. In rich multipath environments, spatially separated channels are independent to each other. Hence, by adapting the interleaving pattern to the channel of the legitimate user, more diversity gain is provided to the legitimate user compared to an eavesdropper. This ensures secrecy in a time division duplex system, where the eavesdropper has no information regarding the channel of the legitimate user. The scheme can also be used in the conventional frequency division duplex system, which is more challenging in terms of security aspects because of the channel state information leakage. We verify the gain of our scheme by showing the improvement in the bit error rate performance.},

abstract={A Polarization state Modulation based Physical Layer Security (PM-PLS) scheme is proposed to enhance the physical layer security of the wireless communication system. Such scheme uses the normal communication signal as the carrier, and conceals the confidential information in the carrier's polarization state. Moreover, utilizing the polarized channel differentia, the eavesdropper's channel quality can be severely worsened. Therefore, through PM-PLS scheme, both anti-detection and modulation information protection can be achieved. Furthermore, based on the proposed polarization constellation structure and polarization constellation encryption method, the depolarization effect caused impact to the desired receiver and eavesdropper are respectively analyzed.

abstract={With development of mobile communication, transmission load of cellular network has greatly increased. In order to relieve spectrum resource scarcity, heterogeneous cellular network has been proposed. In heterogeneous cellular networks, D2D users share frequency resource with cellular users, which improves frequency efficiency effectively. However, serious security problem may be incurred since cellular users are able to overhear information from D2D users underlying in cellular communication links. This paper focuses on improving the secrecy capacity of D2D users in a heterogeneous cellular network by designing adaptive power control and access control schemes. Specifically, we firstly determined a basic security area in which cellular users can be regarded as eligible access objects for D2D users. Then the optimal expression of D2D transmitting power is determined when D2D users share resource with a cellular user located in the basic security area. Finally, we selected a cellular user for D2D pair to access according to the level of information confidentiality. When there's high level of information confidentiality, the Simulated Annealing Algorithm was performed to find a cellular user in order to improve security capacity as much as possible. When D2D pairs communicated normal information, the access object was randomly selected from all cellular users located in basic safety area.},

volume={},

pages={1207-1212}, 
abstract={Ensuring secure command and control in a tactical military environment is vital as the combat forces face many potentially sophisticated adversaries who seek out the vulnerabilities in the communications infrastructure. Although authentication schemes has been substantially explored, the ability of new techniques to coexist with existing system (i.e., legacy systems) is often overlooked. The objective of this work is to establish feasibility of a physical (PHY) layer authentication technique that can be implemented easily to coexist with legacy systems. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of a PHY layer authentication scheme that can seamlessly integrate within systems containing legacy receivers, which do not have the ability to decode PHY layer authentication tags. To this end, we design and evaluate a quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) and π/4 Differential quadrature phase shift keying (DQPSK) based authentication schemes and demonstrate their operation with legacy as well as non-legacy receivers. The addressed authentication scheme follows constellation perturbation by a pre-determined angle which performs the tag embedding without incurring additional network bandwidth. The implementation and evaluation platform consists of a software defined radio (SDR) testbed by using the open source radio framework, GNU Radio, and Universal Software Radio Peripherals (USRP-N210s). For moderate to high signal-to-noise ratios, the QPSK tagging scheme achieves low (<;10-4) bit error rates (BER) and tag error rates (TER); this is due to a novel phase locked loop (PLL) design. The use of forward error correction (FEC) on the tag is also considered, and an improved TER and power saving is demonstrated. Results from our wireless SDR experiments validate the mechanism and demonstrate the practicality of the approach.},

volume={},

pages={1213-1218}, 
abstract={We posit that commercial Wi-Fi-based unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are vulnerable to common and basic security attacks, capable by beginner to intermediate hackers. We do this by demonstrating that the standard ARDiscovery Connection process and the Wi-Fi access point used in the Parrot Bebop UAV are exploitable such that the UAV's ability to fly can be disrupted mid-flight by a remote attacker. We believe that these vulnerabilities are systemic in Wi-Fi-based Parrot UAVs. Our approach observed the normal operation (i.e., ARDiscovery Connection process over Wi-Fi) of the Parrot Bebop UAV. We then used a fuzzing technique to discover that the Parrot Bebop UAV is vulnerable to basic denial of service (DoS) and buffer-overflow attacks during its ARDiscovery Connection process. The exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in catastrophic and immediate disabling of the UAV's rotors midflight. Also, we discovered that the Parrot Bebop UAV is vulnerable to a basic ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Cache Poisoning attack, which can disconnect the primary mobile device user and in most cases cause the UAV to land or return home. Based on the literature and our own penetration testing, we assert that Wi-Fi-based commercial UAVs require a comprehensive security framework that utilizes a defense-in-depth approach. This approach would likely mitigate security risks associated with the three zero-day vulnerabilities described in this paper as well as other vulnerabilities reported in the literature. This framework will be effective for Parrot Wi-Fi-based commercial UAVs and likely others with similar platforms.},

abstract={Vehicles are increasingly wirelessly connected and each wireless connection is a potential cyber threat surface. Many of these wireless communications are related to the infotainment systems and are optional, some are not. Since 2008, when the U.S. government mandated the need for real-time tire pressure diagnostics, automotive manufacturers have inserted Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)-based devices in all vehicles sold domestically. These sensors are divided into “direct” and “indirect” TPMS based on the mechanisms used to observe the tire pressure, temperature, and other characteristics; while marginally more expensive, most such systems are directly embedded in the tire to achieve the diagnostics requirements stated in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [1], [2], necessitating a wireless communications link back to a car's Controller Area Network (CAN) bus and engine control unit (ECU). In this paper, we seek to evaluate the cyber-security of that TPMS wireless communications interface, proposing and evaluating the viability of incorporating a more secure TPMS protocol that takes advantage of simple linear feedback shift register (LFSR)-based message encryption. The proposed models were designed and implemented in both a Universal Serial Radio Peripheral (USRP) N210 software defined radio (SDR) testbed that replicates each side of the TPMS link; the resulting capabilities were also simulated on an inexpensive Arduino platform to demonstrate cost realism in the threat to the TPMS system.},

abstract={Many of the benefits of an Internet of Things sensor network model stem from the extremely long service life of its base sensing layer. When data from the base sensing layer is provided by very low power technologies, such as Bluetooth Low Energy, a class of vulnerabilities called Denial of Sleep attacks can be especially devastating to the network. These attacks can reduce the lifespan of the sensing nodes by several orders of magnitude, rendering the network largely unusable. This paper investigates a Denial of Sleep attack against the Bluetooth Low Energy protocol that allows a malicious actor to rapidly drain the battery of a targeted sensing node, including power analysis, simulation results, and an example implementation. The outcome will be utilized to build better defenses and more predictable environments.},

abstract={Accurate measurement of the quality of systems is crucial to building trustworthy systems. Such a measurement indicates whether a system is working properly and meeting its requirements. Although security and dependability metrics are regarded as key metrics for measuring the quality of systems, they are not sufficient for measuring the quality of systems that are placed in a multi-domain environment including hardware, software, network, human factors, and physical environments. In order to embrace multidimensional aspects of the quality of a system, we introduce a trustworthiness metric framework that supports three key submetrics of trust, resilience, and agility, and propose an ontology-based framework with three corresponding sub-ontologies. We also discuss how the key metrics are related to the severity of threats and the quality of assessment tools. This work is part of the cyber defense effort conducted by the Trustworthy Systems Working Group (TSWG) under the Cyber Strategic Challenge Group (CSCG) of The Technical Cooperation Program (TTCP), which is an international cooperation organization for enhancing defense science and technology.},

abstract={Free open wireless Internet access is a complimentary Wi-Fi service offered by most coffee shops, fast food restaurants and airports to their customers. For ease of access, these Wi-Fi networks are inherently insecure where no authentication/ encryption is used to protect customers wireless data. An attacker can easily deceive a wireless customer (WC) by setting up a rogue access point (RAP) impersonating the legitimate access point (LAP). The WC connecting to the RAP becomes an easy target to the Man-In-the-Middle Attack (MIMA) and data traffic snooping. In this paper, we present a real-time client-side detection scheme to detect evil twin attack (ETA) when the attacker relies on the LAP to direct WC data to the Internet. The WC can detect ETA by monitoring multiple Wi-Fi channels in a random order looking for specific data packets sent by a dedicated sever on the Internet. Once an ETA is detected, our scheme can clearly identify whether a specific AP is a LAP or a RAP. The effectiveness of the proposed detection method was mathematically modeled, prototyped and evaluated in real life environment with a detection rate approximates to 100%.},

abstract={Information Centric Networking (ICN) is a proposal for a future network architecture that shifts from the current end-to-end host based TCP/IP internet architecture by prioritizing content rather than hosts. To this end, ICN relies on in-network caching where routers cache content they have seen with the hope of satisfying future requests for the same content and relieving the original data servers. While in-network caching proved beneficial for a more efficient retrieval of content, it has also caused the emergence of several privacy risks. Timing attacks are one such privacy breach where attackers use timing analysis of data retrievals to analyze users' interests in particular content. In this paper, we propose centrality-based caching to mitigate such attacks and use the anonymity set privacy metric to show that our strategy does provide privacy guarantees. Moreover, our simulations show that we can still achieve high hit rates and low delays while alleviating the network's vulnerability to timing attacks.},

Malicious nodes judiciously and dynamically make the balance between maintaining its social trust and selfishly maximizing its malicious gain over a long time-span. Studying the optimal response strategies for each malicious node could assist to design the best system maneuver so as to achieve the targeted level of overall malicious activities. In this paper, we propose an interaction-based social trust model, and formulate the maximization of long-term malicious gains of multiple competing nodes as a non-cooperative differential game.

abstract={Tactical Edge Networks are one of the most challenging communication environments, where node mobility, constrained devices, and the wide use of wireless ad hoc channels for communications cause frequent link disruption and network partitioning. Additionally, applications running in Tactical Edge Networks often follow one-to-many and many-to-many communication models that require the nodes' cooperation to enable data delivery. Many studies proposed the use of peer-to-peer systems in mobile ad hoc networks to remove any dependency on centralized nodes and to cope with link disruptions and network partitioning phenomena that derive from the extreme dynamicity of Tactical Edge Networks. In this paper, we compare the performance of file sharing in mobile ad hoc networks using an implementation of the BitTorrent peer-to-peer protocol and DisService, a middleware for information dissemination specifically designed for Tactical Edge Networks. DisService supports applications with routing and peer-to-peer content delivery in mobile ad hoc networks. We ran several experiments in an emulated environment to evaluate the performance of each solution when sharing large files. The obtained results show that TEN-specific solutions such as DisService can outperform traditional peer-to-peer solutions like BitTorrent.},

abstract={This paper presents experimental verification of the performance of Group Centric Networking (GCN), a networking protocol developed for robust and scalable communications in lossy networks where users are localized to geographic areas, such as military tactical networks. Initial simulations in NS3 showed that GCN offers high delivery with low network overhead in the presence of high packet loss and high mobility. We extend the investigation to verify GCN's performance in actual over-the-air experimentation. In the experiments, we deployed GCN on a 90-node Android phone test bed distributed across an office building, allowing us to evaluate its performance over-the-air on real-world hardware. GCN's performance is compared against multiple popular wireless routing protocols, which we also run over-the-air. These tests yield two notable results: (1) the seemingly benign environment of an office is in fact quite lossy, with high packet error rates between users that are geographically close to one another, and (2) that GCN does indeed offer high delivery with low network overhead, which is in contrast to traditional wireless routing schemes that offer either high delivery or low overhead, or sometimes neither.},

pages={1286-1291}, 
abstract={The use of higher order amplitude and phase shift keying (APSK) modulations allows for increased capacity and spectral efficiency, at the expense of greater transmit power requirements or reduced range. Their adoption in over-the-air communication standards has been paired with highly efficient forward error correction (FEC) techniques such as low density parity check (LDPC) coding which greatly reduces the required operating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Maintaining phase coherence for these higher order modulations across a wide range of data rates, at lower SNRs due to the use of FEC coding, presents unique receiver design challenges. Waveform specifications provide little intuition as to how to overcome these. This paper discusses and addresses these design challenges. Specifically, challenges relating to Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation of traditional acquisition and tracking schemes across a wide range of symbol rates which approach or exceed the system clock rate.},

volume={},

pages={1292-1297}, 
abstract={This paper applies a novel analysis technique to examine the impact of frequency offset estimation errors on a single-carrier system equipped with a pilot (or preamble) sequence to estimate the frequency offset and the channel and operating over an ISI channel. The analysis shows that when certain conditions are achieved, the equalizer output is a heterodyned version of the equalizer output when no frequency offset is present. This observation motivated the inclusion of a PLL to track out the frequency offset at the equalizer output. As a byproduct of the analysis, a criterion defining “frequency offset optimized” pilot sequences was developed. Simulation results using QPSK show that a 1 dB loss in BER performance occurs when the frequency offset error is 0:002 cycles/symbol. This was contrasted with a purely feedforward approach that required a more complex frequency offset estimator whose error is three orders of magnitude smaller. The example demonstrates how the addition of a relatively simple PLL at the equalizer output can relax the strict performance requirements of the frequency offset estimator.},

year={2015}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={1-6}, 
abstract={Insider attack detection in an enterprise network environment is a critical problem that currently has no promising solution. It represents a significant challenge since host availability and performance requirements cannot be ignored. A network based approach allows these requirements to be met but is limited by the granularity of data available and the near impossibility of defining exact signatures for known attack types. Anomaly detection approaches suffer from the well known problem of false positives making them hard to apply in enterprise environments where even a moderate false positive rate is not acceptable. Sophisticated attacks and complex network topologies make it hard to apply simplistic approaches to anomaly detection. This paper presents an approach that applies the unsupervised learning techniques of bi-clustering and one-class SVM to so-called weak indicators of network attacks. This approach is well suited for network flow data that is coarse grained and not amenable to simplistic anomaly detection or signature-based techniques. Further, our approach allows a security analyst to determine the cause of the anomaly, a capability that is typically not supportable by simplistic applications of unsupervised learning.},

title={Enforcing agile access control policies in relational databases using views}, 
year={2015}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={7-12}, 
abstract={Access control is used in databases to prevent unauthorized retrieval and tampering of stored data, as defined by policies. Various policy models provide different protections and guarantees against illegal accesses, but none is able to offer a universal fit for all access control needs. Therefore, the static nature of access control mechanisms deployed in commercial databases limit the security guarantees provided. They require time-consuming and error-prone efforts to adapt access control policies to evolving security contexts. In contrast, we propose a fully automated and agile approach to access control enforcement in relational databases. We present tractable algorithms that enforce any policy expressible using the high-level syntax of the Authorization Specification Language. This includes complex policies involving information flow control or user history dependencies. Our method does not require any modification to the database schema or user queries, thus allowing for a transparent implementation in existing systems. We demonstrate our findings by formulating two classic access control models: the Bell-LaPadula model and the Chinese Wall policy.},

pages={13-18}, 
abstract={We describe a system developed for the DARPA Wireless Network Defense (WND) program for detecting attacks against the control plane at the link and network layers in a mobile ad hoc network. The goal of our system is for each node to independently assess the trustworthiness of other nodes in its neighborhood, and to disseminate these assessments to other nodes. We have developed a cross-layer invariant-based technique for detecting control plane attacks that exploits the readily observable nature of the wireless medium. Nodes listen to the transmissions of other nodes in their neighborhood and compare their observed behavior with expected behavior. Opinions formed by nodes are shared with other nodes and are combined at each node to form a consolidated opinion about other nodes in the network. We tested our approach in a realistic environment using a high fidelity ns-2 simulation of a 50-node scenario provided by ARL and running 802.11 and OLSR that included multiple subnets, realistic tactical traffic, wireless channels and ranges, propagation models, and variations of mobility. We injected a wide range of attacks and a varied number of attackers, with attacks that included a randomized and variable number of false advertisements for the above protocols as well as malicious forwarding behaviors with varying drop rates, with and without colluding attackers. Our results show that we exceeded all of the WND metrics, namely: (i) We achieved a detection rate of greater than 95% for all attacks; (ii) Probability of false alarms <;0.0005%; (iii) Additional network overhead due to reliability estimation <;1% of network capacity.},

abstract={Moving-target defense is an effective strategy for deflecting cyber attacks. The widespread use of smartphones in the tactical field requires novel ways of securing smartphones against an ever-increasing number of zero-day attacks. We propose a new, proactive approach for securing smartphone apps against certain classes of attacks. We leverage smartphone's native support for quick and lossless restarts to make application restart a cyber maneuver meant to deflect and confuse attackers. We propose a time-series entropy metric to quantify attack resilience. We apply our approach to 12 popular Android apps chosen from a variety of domains, including online banking and shopping. Preliminary experiments with using proactive restarts on these apps show that restart is a promising way of increasing attack resilience for a certain class of side-channel attacks named Activity Inference attacks.},

year={2015}, 
volume={},

pages={25-30}, 
abstract={Advanced persistent threat (APT) is becoming a major threat to cyber security. As APT attacks are often launched by well funded entities that are persistent and stealthy in achieving their goals, they are highly challenging to combat in a cost-effective way. The situation becomes even worse when a sophisticated attacker is further assisted by an insider with privileged access to the inside information. Although stealthy attacks and insider threats have been considered separately in previous works, the coupling of the two is not well understood. As both types of threats are incentive driven, game theory provides a proper tool to understand the fundamental tradeoffs involved. In this paper, we propose the first three-player attacker-defender-insider game to model the strategic interactions among the three parties. Our game extends the two-player FlipIt game model for stealthy takeover by introducing an insider that can trade information to the attacker for a profit. We characterize the subgame perfect equilibria of the game with the defender as the leader and the attacker and the insider as the followers, under two different information trading processes. We make various observations and discuss approaches for achieving more efficient defense in the face of both APT and insider threats.},

We outline preliminary considerations such as mission goals, operating conditions and maneuvers to be evaluated. Then, we introduce notional measures of health, security and capability and their interrelationship resulting in an initial framework design. A simple defensive cyber operation of securing a critical communication path for some time duration, both with and without the presence of a detected infection, is provided to illustrate the framework components and mission considerations that must be made before selecting a sequence of maneuvers.},

year={2015}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={37-42}, 
abstract={International military forces are increasingly engaged in coalition-based operations with an expectation that future coalition forces will be tightly interoperable even down to the tactical level. At the same time, there is an emerging trend towards increasing connectivity at the tactical edge, with mobile ad hoc networking (MANET) seen as a key enabling technology for this improved connectivity. This paper explores the convergence of these two trends-a desire for secure coalition interoperability and its potential co-existence with a MANET-based tactical communication platform. We present an architecture consisting of three elements that enable allied MANETs to share information securely: a key management strategy, gateway discovery and security association and network address translation. These concepts are well researched individually; in this paper we combine them in the context of a coalition tactical operation. We present several tactical scenarios in which our architecture enables a MANET to discover nearby allied MANETs, to identify and authenticate gateways to relay its information and to connect specialized nodes of allied MANETs and establish communities of interest. Our solutions could serve as models for the future development of secure interoperability policies, service level agreements and standards, e.g., for future NATO standardization agreements (STANAGs) or Combined Communications-Electronics Board Allied Communication Publications (CCEB ACPs).},

abstract={Block ciphers are essential cryptographic primitives used for encryption in resource constrained hardware systems. Many modern block ciphers are based on the substitution permutation network (SPN) design. The substitution step is commonly the only non-linear transformation in the cipher, and is usually comprised of a permutation which applies an S-box substitution to each element of the cipher state. In hardware, the S-box implementation has a significant impact on the area consumed by the cipher. Consequently, there have been considerable research and engineering efforts to obtain compact circuit implementations of S-boxes for hardware systems. Building on past work, we present a comprehensive methodology for (1) constructing cryptographically strong affine-power S-boxes over Galois fields and (2) minimizing the VLSI technology-independent combinational logic requirements for their circuit implementations. Motivated by the potential need for larger S-boxes with improved cryptographic properties, we use this methodology to construct area minimized circuits for novel 16-bit S-boxes.},

abstract={Due to the dire consequences of privacy abuse in vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), a number of mechanisms have been put forth to conditionally preserve the user and location privacy. To date, multiple pseudonymous approach is regarded as one of the best effective solutions where every node uses multiple temporary pseudonyms. However, recently it has been found out that even multiple pseudonyms could be linked to each other and to a single node thereby jeopardizing the privacy. Therefore in this paper, we propose a novel identity exchange-based approach to preserve user privacy in VANET where a node exchanges its pseudonyms with the neighbors and uses both its own and neighbors' pseudonym randomly to preserve privacy. Additionally the revocation of the immediate user of the pseudonym is made possible through an efficient revocation mechanism. Moreover the pseudonym exchange is realized through covert communication where a side channel is used to establish a covert communication path between the exchanging nodes, based on the scheduled beacons. Our proposed scheme is secure, robust, and it preserves privacy through the existing beacon infrastructure.},

abstract={Information (and its timely delivery) has always been one of the most critical tactical assets. Today, we have the technology to deploy data collection and retrieval systems all the way from mission headquarters down to the lowest levels of echelon. Due to the lower echelons proximity to the adversary, protecting the information is one of the most important issues in designing such systems. In this paper, we describe a secure distributed storage scheme to be used especially at and near the tactical edge. The scheme does so through a peer-to-peer overlay and storage protocol designed to run on existing networked systems. We utilize a structured overlay that is dynamically organized in a layered, hierarchical manner based on the existing military command structure (e.g. fire-team, squad, battalion, etc.). These layers are used as storage sites for pieces of data near the layer at which that data is needed. The data is generated and distributed via an information dispersal algorithm (IDA) utilizing an erasure code such as the common Cauchy Reed-Solomon (RS). Through the use of this IDA, the data pieces are organized across neighboring layers to maximize locality. This organization also prevents a compromise within one layer from compromising data in that layer. Multiple layers would have to be compromised for a single datum to become compromised. As a result, both security and survivability of the data is improved compared to the typical remote server-client model. We present an overview of this approach along with our experimental results on hardware performance of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) mobile devices. The recorded overhead (encoding/ decoding times and associated data sizes) show that such a scheme can be utilized with little increase in overall latency.},

abstract={Electromagnetic spectrum congestion is a serious problem. The majority of the desirable spectrum lie below 6 GHz, and is consumed by communication and RADAR systems. DARPA's Shared Spectrum Access for Radar and Communications (SSPARC) program seeks to improve efficient use of spectrum by allowing RADAR and communication systems to share spectrum in the 3.5 GHz S-band. In this paper, we present some results on the MAC layer performance of the IEEE 802.11 protocol in the presence of RADAR interference. We propose a simple model for the carrier sense multiple access mechanism and use it to gain insight into some important performance metrics such as MAC layer throughput, and packet service time. Finally, we provide some numerical examples to demonstrate the usefulness of the results in designing spectrum sharing strategies in real systems.},

abstract={Nowadays, receivers can separate multiple transmitted packets simultaneously through the use of advanced signal processing techniques. This capability is called multi-packet reception (MPR). Currently, several proposals have been made to modify the operation of 802.11 and take advantage of the MPR capability. However, under multi-rate transmissions, these techniques suffer from the phenomenon known as performance anomaly, which results in MPR being under-utilized. In this paper, it is proposed a multi-round transmission (MRT) method for exploiting the MPR capability in the uplink channel over 802.11 wireless local area networks (WLANs). The proposed method schedules the access to the channel through multiple rounds during the transmission period. Analytical performance is provided and verified with simulations. Results indicate that the MRT method proves an improvement in average throughput closer to 100% when compared to previous approaches.},

pages={85-90}, 
abstract={In the satellite networks (SATNETs), the random access (RA) schemes are studied to transmit the bursty traffic because the dedicated access (DA) schemes are inefficient to transmit bursty traffic due to overhead caused by control message. The slotted ALOHA (SA), used in the SATNETs, has low throughput owing to the collision between packets. Therefore, studies have been conducted to improve the throughput. The contention resolution diversity SA (CRDSA) and irregular repetition SA (IRSA) improve the throughput by using replica packets and successive interference cancellation (SIC). In particular, Reservation-CRDSA (R-CRDSA), the latest RA scheme, has higher throughput and greater stability than the CRDSA by using the slot reservation. However, in R-CRDSA, most slots are unused when the offered load is low because the satellite terminals (STs) can reserve only one slot in a frame. Furthermore, the ST that has a number of packets, needs many frames to transmit packets. To resolve this problem, we proposes a new slot reservation scheme called multiple slot reservation-CRDSA (MR-CRDSA). In our proposed scheme, the STs reserves a number of slots according to message size. Consequently, the STs can transmit many packet in a frame. In this paper, the algorithm to reserve multiple slots is proposed, which considers the fairness between STs as well as message size. To verify the performance of MR-CRDSA in the practical system, the performance is investigated through the simulation.},

abstract={The military organizations around the world are increasingly adopting commercial cellular standards for their mission critical communication networks. Most of the cellular standards include support for several new techniques to implement network-wide load balancing to obtain optimum network performance. The goal of this paper is to understand the effect of load balancing on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as throughput and user-perceived delay. We first introduce analytical models to describe sector throughput as a function of the number of active users. We also develop models to study the delay experienced by HTTP traffic sources. Using these models, we quantify the gains achieved from performing load balancing and demonstrate that load balancing achieves significant performance gains in terms of sector capacity and user experience.},

year={2015}, 
volume={},

pages={97-102}, 
abstract={Traditional algorithms for Media Access Control (MAC) in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET) such as CSMA-CA allow only a single user to transmit at a given time. This means that the sum throughput in a MANET cannot increase to service additional users. Such MAC protocols disregard the possibility that by utilizing multiple antenna processing to handle interference intelligently at the Physical layer (PHY), many concurrent user transmissions can co-exist. Previous works have proposed altered versions of CSMA-CA that allow multi user operation but may not necessarily be able to coexist with an existing IEEE 802:11 based network. This paper proposes a Concurrent CSMA MAC protocol that is completely compatible with traditional CSMA based MAC and follows the same timing structure allowing co-existence of both protocols. Specifically, in Concurrent CSMA after a primary user has captured the channel, secondary users listen to the RTS/CTS handshake and form a beamnull towards the primary receiver. Hence secondary users can communicate concurrently with minimal increase in interference to the primary receiver. Simulations show that the proposed PHY and MAC scheme is able to achieve 2 to 3 times the network spectral efficiency of CSMA with a single antenna and this improvement factor is sustained as the network scales in size. Further the proposed scheme allows the network spectral efficiency (sum throughput per unit bandwidth) to scale with users and improves upon a previous promising approach which uses Interference Alignment.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a medium access control (MAC) protocol to maximize the connectivity for an un-coordinated secondary dynamic spectrum access network under the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) regime. We use concepts from percolation theory to obtain the optimal deployment density for secondary nodes. We argue that the optimal connectivity under the SINR regime can be improved if a fraction of the nodes transmit at a given time. Thus, the proposed MAC is based on distributed Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) where all nodes randomly choose a time slot to transmit on, a phenomenon similar to the Poisson blinking model. We find the optimal number of slots for the super-frame that includes the sensing, contention, and transmission phases. The performance of the proposed MAC is evaluated via simulations. We show how the proposed MAC adaptively adjusts the super-frame as the density of secondary varies. We also show the connectivity and throughput achieved for various network settings1.},

abstract={This paper presents a rate adaptation algorithm for directional multicast communication in tactical networks. The proposed algorithm is based on the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and delay constraint that are sent by receivers in the network. This feedback from receivers provides accurate real-time information about the current state of the communication channel so that the transmission rates can be varied to reduce the loss of the transmitted data packets. Typically, rate adaptation algorithms consider packet loss, modify frames in only the MAC layer, and accordingly change modulation scheme employed by the transmitter. In the proposed method, the modulation technique used for data transmission is changed according to the RSSI by considering the delay constraints of transmission to ensure satisfactory real-time performance. Simulation results show that the proposed method based on the IEEE 802.11a standard ensure good performance and reliability in terms of reduced the delay, increase throughput and the number of nodes that received data.},

The proposed multicast routing protocol is built as a MANET extension to the popular Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) routing protocol used in wired networks; hence, we call our scheme PIM-MANET. Similar to PIM, PIM-MANET is agnostic of the unicast routing protocol that is used to connect users in the network. PIM-MANET extends PIM to the wireless domain by implementing required features such as Duplicate Packet Detection (DPD) to avoid routing loops, removing extraneous messaging, and using a novel tree creation mechanism to form multicast trees that achieve better performance in presence of asymmetric links. We implement the PIM-MANET protocol as a routing daemon for the Linux environment and show the benefits of our approach over currently used MANET multicast protocols.},

abstract={Cooperative communication is one of the efficient techniques to support statistical delay-bounded quality-of-service (QoS) multimedia (audio/video) services over mobile wireless networks by employing relay nodes, which forward the signal received from source node to the destination. Wireless network virtualization provides another efficient technique to implement the data transmissions by enabling multiple virtual wireless networks (VWNs) to be mapped onto one physical substrate wireless network (SWN), increasing the utilization efficiency of SWN. Applying the cooperative communication to virtual wireless networks provides a significant improvement on time-sensitive multimedia services in order to support the diverse quality of service requirements over mobile wireless networks. One of the most important challenges of this application lies in how to efficiently allocate the wireless resources of physical wireless networks to the multiple virtual wireless network users, taking into account the statistical delay-bounded QoS for the multimedia information transmission. To overcome this difficulty, in this paper we propose a novel game-theory based scheme to resolve the wireless resources allocation problem in terms of transmit power, aiming at maximizing the effective-capacity to guarantee the statistical delay-bounded QoS for wireless multimedia communications. We formulate this wireless resources allocation problem as follows. A mobile user starts with asking for the cooperation from the other virtual users in the same virtual network to be as its relay nodes. When at least one virtual user agrees to cooperate, the mobile user executes the following two gaming processes. First, the mobile user bids for the source-node-transmit-power resources from SWN. Second, at the same time the mobile user bids for the relay-transmit-power from those cooperated virtual users, coordinating with the first bid strategies to maximize its payoff (performance-gain minus cost) in each b- d round. The extensive simulation results obtained validate and evaluate our proposed schemes.},

abstract={Saliency detection in videos has attracted great attention in recent years due to its wide range of applications. In this paper, a novel spatiotemporal saliency detection model based on clustering is proposed. The discrete cosine transform coefficients are used as features to generate the spatial saliency map firstly. We utilize 2D Gaussian function to estimate the absolute feature difference in consideration of video resolution. Multiple spatial saliency maps which indicate different features are constructed and linearly combined to obtain the overall spatial saliency map. Then, a hierarchical structure is utilized to obtain the temporal saliency map using the extracted motion vectors that belong to the foreground. In addition, spatial and temporal saliency maps are clustered into non-overlapping regions automatically based on the histogram of each saliency map.

abstract={In this paper we present a MIMO model for a line-of-sight (LOS) satellite communication (SATCOM) channel, utilising orthogonal circular polarizations and spatial diversity from multiple satellites in geostationary orbit. To achieve spatial orthogonality in a LOS SATCOM channel, antenna separation of the order of hundreds of kilometres is required, either on the ground or in space. In this paper we consider small spacing between the ground terminals, and thus large separation between antennas in space by means of multiple satellites. Orbital slots for multiple satellites within two degrees are generally not viable due to adjacent satellite interference (ASI) issues from disadvantaged small user terminals. In this work we show how to benefit with MIMO spatial multiplexing and multiple satellites with closer orbital spaces. In addition to spatial multiplexing, orthogonal polarizations can double the overall bandwidth. In a SISO context, depolarization and cross talk between orthogonal polarizations are often expressed in terms of cross-polar discrimination (XPD) and cross-polar isolation (XPI) respectively. In a MIMO context, we show that polarization orthogonality is of more significance than antenna XPD or XPI. The capacity results show that significant improvement can be achieved with multiple satellites and polarization MIMO compared to conventional SISO SATCOM.},

pages={169-174}, 
abstract={This paper presents a working distributed SATCOM policy enforcement (SPE) software prototype that protects priority traffic in tactical SATCOM networks. The SPE software is designed for distributed deployment at SATCOM terminals and is compatible with communication security (COMSEC) considerations where mission data originated by applications operating on protected computing systems is encrypted prior to transport by SATCOM communication systems. Each SPE instance operates as an independent feedback-based control process and performs the following key high-level functions: (1) Periodically query the aggregate SATCOM subnet capacity utilization, (2) compute new policy-based traffic policing configuration settings for the local SATCOM router to protect priority flows based on the measured subnet utilization and (3) send commands to the local SATCOM router to enforce the computed traffic policing settings. The SPE prototype has been successfully demonstrated in both commercial router and simulation environments that model a 3-node SATCOM subnet scenario. Experimental results reported here for the SPE software provide proof-of-concept validation of its ability to dynamically enforce policy-based priority-aware policing of network traffic. The results include both quantitative throughput performance gains for high-priority traffic and visual demonstration of enhanced priority video rendering.},

abstract={NATO forces rely on satellite communications (SATCOM) for the larger part of their intra-theatre wide-area network (WAN) communication requirements. Lack of SATCOM bandwidth and increasing costs make it necessary to explore non-SATCOM alternatives for intra-theatre WAN wireless transmission services that can cope with the demanding operational requirements of modern military expeditionary operations. NATO Communications and Information Agency has been conducting investigations and experimentation of new concepts and technologies in this area, culminating in a comprehensive vision for a mix of next-generation wireless WAN terrestrial transmission systems. However, it is very difficult to gauge the true potential of these types of systems in expeditionary operations. On the one hand, such operations have a large gamut of possible scenarios; on the other hand, different stakeholders have different views and interests. Commercial vendors prefer to use benign wireless scenarios against which to gauge their systems, whereas military users want to know the true potential of terrestrial wireless systems in the real world. In this context, the Agency developed a practical methodology to assess the performance and potential of wireless WAN systems in expeditionary operations scenarios. This paper presents that methodology and applies it to the mix of future-generation WAN wireless transmission systems for NATO Expeditionary Operations, and presents the results to the military communications community.},

abstract={The focus of this paper is the multimodal detection and localization of a ground moving target based on radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data. The target radiates a low probability of intercept (LPI) RF signal received by multiple passive RF sensors at scene and is imaged by using a stationary IR camera concurrently. To obtain the multimodal detector proposed in this paper, first, the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is employed to derive the RF and IR detectors individually. Then, the RF and IR detectors are integrated optimally to get the integrated GLRT. In order to avoid the computational complexity associated with the integrated GLRT, a suboptimal multimodal detector is implemented by applying the random basis functions (RBF) approach to the IR image sequence to reduce down the search space for the RF detector. It is shown that the suboptimal multimodal detector has better localization performance compared to the RF detector when one of the RF sensors is partially occluded.},

Using such a system as the starting point, the theoretical method for extracting target range information from the receive frequency sweeps and constructing radar imagery is detailed using the pulse echo model. Combining this imaging technique along with the radar hardware yields a system capable of spatially locating targets inside of buildings from standoff distances. Experiments and verification tests of the system were conducted at the Indiana Muscatatuck Urban Training center and results are presented detailing system performance for static and moving targets inside of concrete block buildings.

abstract={Fingerprint-based localization is expected to be superior compared to other conventional range-based localization techniques especially in dense urban scenarios which are generally non line-of-sight (NLOS). However, when we consider localizing illegal radios whose parameters such as bandwidth and center frequency are unknown, there is a high possibility that the initial parameters used to create the fingerprint database in the training phase do not match the illegal radio's parameters. In this paper, a novel fingerprint-based localization technique which utilizes interpolated channel impulse response (CIR) cross-correlations as fingerprints is proposed, which does not require a priori information of the illegal radio. Results show that the proposed technique is very promising in localizing illegal radios in urban NLOS environments.},

We elaborate numerical examples of how to construct these new structures of the non-uniform array. The performances of classic MUSIC method and the augmented matrix MUSIC approach are also compared. We also analyze the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) in the non-uniform sensor deployment and it decreases about 10dB comparing to the uniform linear array (ULA). Additionally, the sparse array can exploit more virtual sensors which are able to detect more sources and have a large dynamic range of the signal peaks to the background. Finally, we provide the detailed performance simulations of 1D and 2D nested array and co-prime array respectively.},

abstract={Ultra wideband (UWB) impulse radio technology has been widely researched for sensor applications and communication systems. In the radar system, detection performance is determined by a threshold. However, setting a proper threshold for maximizing detection performance is challenging without knowledge of exact noise power. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms that estimate noise power by adopting a divide-and-conquer algorithm to set a threshold for maximizing detection performance under the Neyman-Pearson criterion for UWB radar signals. The proposed algorithm can be easily applied to existing detectors. Simulation results show that the performance of detection with our proposed algorithm is closely matches to statistical model bounds, and required signal-to-noise ratio for perfect detection is less than constant false alarm rate detectors.},

abstract={In cognitive radio (CR) networks, secondary users (SUs) detect and share a spectrum band assigned to a primary user (PU) to communicate with their respective secondary receivers. In order to increase the reliability of the detection performance, the SUs cooperatively sense the spectrum by reporting their local information to a fusion center (FC) after quantization. For an accurate information transferring, the use of the enormous number of quantization bits for reporting is preferred, however, it simultaneously degrades the throughput performance in the perspective of reporting-throughput tradeoff. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we focus on the throughput enhancement for the secondary networks while satisfying a target sensing performance. To this end, we derive the quantized local test statistics of energy detector and propose the quantization bit allocation strategy that maximizes the throughput performance. Moreover, we introduce an adaptive framework to employ the proposed resource allocation scheme in a dynamic environment. Through the numerical results, it is shown that the proposed work exhibits the enhanced throughput performance unlike the conventional schemes.},

abstract={Spectral efficiency and energy efficiency are fundamental trade-off in wireless communications. Spectral efficiency (SE), defined as the average data rate per unit bandwidth, quantifies how efficiently the available spectrum is utilized. Energy efficiency (EE), defined as the successful transmitted information bits per unit energy from transmitter to receiver, quantifies how efficiently the energy is utilized. Basically, with higher average energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio at the receiver, the packet can be more successfully detected, thus utilizing the spectrum more efficiently, giving higher SE; however, in this case, it requires more energy, lowering EE, and vice versa. In this paper, we study the trade-off between SE and EE, specifically for the cognitive radio considering its configurability. We propose a general metric SEE (Spectral/Energy Efficiency) to facilitate the analysis which quantifies the preference of SE or EE. Closed-form solutions for symbol transmission energy and the length of information bits per frame are obtained for various combined modulation and channel coding schemes. The closed-form solutions further facilitate the adaptivity of cognitive radio considering both SE and EE in various scenarios. Using the proposed metric shows that our scheme is capable to perform balanced trade-off between SE and EE. Considering only maximizing SE, our scheme gains much larger EE while only sacrificing little SE; and comparing with maximizing EE, larger SE can be obtained while sacrificing a small amount EE.},

abstract={In the static and exclusive spectrum allocation paradigm, the spectrum-access parameters for a service are chosen to mitigate potential harmful-interference and ensure minimum performance under worst-case conditions. The new dynamic spectrum-sharing paradigm necessitates dynamically defining and enforcing the spectrum-access rights while accommodating the dynamics of the RF environment and the spectrum-access scenarios. To enforce spectrum-access rights, we emphasize capturing the use of spectrum by an individual transceiver. We propose to articulate the spectrum-access rights in terms of the characterization of the spectrum used by an individual transceiver in the space, time, and frequency dimensions. In order to estimate the use of spectrum in real time, we employ a dedicated RF-sensor network that uses interference-tolerant algorithms to estimate the transceiver spectrum-access parameters and to characterize the propagation environment. We illustrate defining and enforcing a spectrum-access policy and we bring out its advantages for dynamic spectrum sharing.},

abstract={In order to reduce sampling costs and computational complexity in the signal reconstruction process of existing compressed spectrum sensing (CSS), we propose a novel two-step compressed spectrum sensing (TS-CSS) scheme exploiting correlation of occupation states between sensing periods. At the first step of TS-CSS, we detect busy sub-channels of last sensing period to find the sub-channels that are still busy in current sensing period. In this way, part of supports of received signal is known and the remainder of the signal is a sparser signal than the original. Then the second step adjusts number of samples collected in the compressive sampling process according to number of unknown supports. By doing so, overall sampling rate and computational complexity are minimized. Compared with traditional one step compressed spectrum sensing (OS-CSS) scheme, our TS-CSS needs fewer samples and lower computations to yield an accurate sensing outcome. Valid simulation is conducted in the work.},

However, in a spectrally congested environment or a spectrally contested environment which often occurs in cyber security applications, multiple signals are often mixed together with significant overlap in spectrum. In our previous work, we have demonstrated the feasibility of using a second order spectrum correlation function (SCF) cyclostationary feature to perform mixed signal detection, but the detection was confined to BPSK modulation. In this paper, we extend our work to QPSK modulation by using a robust algorithm to detect mixed signals and estimate their symbol rate via spectral coherence function (SOF) features. We also evaluate the detection and estimation performance of the proposed algorithm in various channel conditions and signal mixture scenarios. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

abstract={In this paper, we apply the existing framework of anomaly-based intrusion detection (ABID) to the problem of detecting protocol-aware jammers. These types of jammers target MAC or NET layer control messages in an attempt to increase jamming effectiveness and remain harder to detect. ABID systems detect activities that deviate significantly from the normal profile. Signature recognition is based on storing signatures of known intrusion scenarios, and detecting the presence of these signatures in real-time. By choosing a suitable set of features, a high probability of correct detection can be achieved. Our proposed detection strategy involves tracking the statistics of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and packet type (critical or non-critical). An alternative strategy that only requires information about packet loss is also provided. Through simulation, we show that these types of jammers can be detected in a large portion of scenarios.},

number={}, 
pages={275-280}, 
abstract={Single-Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) uses Cyclic Prefix (CP) to mitigate inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-channel interference (ICI). CP ensures that the convolution of the channel impulse response with the modulated symbols has the form of a circular convolution. This results in simple one-tap equalization in the receiver by removing ICI. These crucial roles played by the CP make SC-FDMA particularly vulnerable to jamming or nulling attacks through CP. These attacks are effective if the CP is disrupted before the symbol interacts with the channel. The attacks that happen to jam the CP after the symbol is already convolved with the channel, reduce to no-jamming scenarios in their effectiveness. But CP disruption ensuring the symbol is not already distorted by channel is practically infeasible. Consequently, we have designed the jammers so that they emulate the effects of CP jamming and nulling in frequency-selective static channel. We have also proposed two novel countermeasures. Simulations are performed to validate the analytical predictions. The results reflect the fact that CP attacks are particularly suitable for power-constrained jammers in high SNR regime. The newly proposed anti-jamming techniques prove to be very effective in restoring the system.},

Further, we exploit multiuser diversity where the SU-Rx with best channel condition is scheduled for transmission. Then, analytical expressions of the probability of existence of non-zero secrecy capacity and secrecy outage probability are obtained. Analytical and simulation results are provided to evaluate the effect of the number of SU-Rxs and number of EAVs on the secondary system.

abstract={This paper presents a novel method for generating a secret key to augment the security of spread spectrum systems. The proposed key generation takes advantage of the channel reciprocity exhibited between two communicating parties. We validate the key generation aspect of our system by using real-world measurements. We note that the strongest path in the channel impulse response can be the main source that will allow an adversary to generate a similar key to those of the legitimate nodes. We resolve this problem by introducing an augmentation that removes the strongest path from the channel impulse response before key generation. This augmentation, that we call strongest path cancellation (SPC), is found very effective. We also note that the generated keys need not be perfectly the same at the legitimate nodes, hence, the proposed method belongs to the class of fault tolerant secure communications. In this paper, without any loss of generality, we use the proposed key generation method as part of a filter bank multicarrier spread spectrum (FB-MC-SS) system, where robust performance against narrow and/or partial band interference is also guaranteed.},

pages={294-299}, 
abstract={Traditional methods of securing communications rely on methods, such as encryption, which require coordination between the transmitter and the receiver. Physical layer encryption techniques propose exploiting transmit arrays to cover the transmitted signal with beamformed noise or to generate directional modulation to provide security without requiring coordination a priori between the transmitter and receiver. These techniques suffer from implementation difficulties such as high computational requirements and higher amplifier linearity requirements. In this paper we propose out-phased array linearized signaling (OPALS) which provides a practical approach to physical-layer encryption through spatial masking. Our approach modifies just the transmitter to employ the outphasing amplifier design to generate a unique masking signal to each element of an antenna array. This approach improves the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the transmitter, provides a high degree of confidentiality, and requires no coordination with or modification to the intended receiver.},

abstract={An important problem is to provide jam resistance for wireless networks. This is more difficult in cases such as GPS, where the sender and receiver do not have a shared secret that is unknown to the jammer. Currently, the only known system for such jam resistance without shared secrets is the BBC algorithm, which is fastest when it uses the Glowworm hash. We present a new type of analysis of Glowworm, using exhaustive search to find the absolutely best possible attack for reduced forms of Glowworm, as well as for the full Glowworm applied to shorter packets. Because we are defending against a stronger threat model (an adversary with infinite computational power), the analysis is actually easier than for a traditional threat model, and we derive much stronger results than would be possible for cryptographic hashes that are designed for a more traditional use. In addition, surprising results were found for its behavior near the boundary conditions. The result is that BBC with Glowworm can be used with great confidence, and it is now clear how to choose the best combination of parameters for practical use. 1},

abstract={The increasing popularity of smartphones and other similar multi-modal wireless devices has created an opportunity for the realization of large-scale hybrid (or heterogeneous) networks. Typically, modern mobile devices are likely to support a short range communication interface (e.g. IEEE 802.11/WiFi) and/or a longer range communication interface (e.g. cellular data link wireless technology). Multi-hop wireless networking over WiFi can help to extend the range of cellular networks in low SINR regions as well as to alleviate network congestion. Conversely, equipping a few nodes in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) with cellular radios can help to heal wireless network partitions and, thus, to improve the overall network connectivity. One can envision large scale group communication (or multicast) applications including real-time video conferencing (e.g., iPhone FaceTime), P2P video and file sharing, and “voice call groups” in disaster relief and military hybrid networks. In this paper, the problem of resource-efficient multicast in hybrid wireless networks which include both point-to-point (cellular) and broadcast (MANET) links is considered. The underlying optimization problem is a hybrid of two well-known NP-hard graph optimization problems-the Minimum Steiner Tree problem (for point-to-point links) and the Minimum Steiner Connected Dominating Set problem (for broadcast links). We consider both edge- and node-weighted versions of this problem and use distinctly different methodologies to give three algorithms with guaranteed approximation factors. We further demonstrate by means of simulation modeling of standard deployment scenarios that while one algorithm outperforms another in terms of the tree cost, the latter outperforms the former in terms of complexity and other practical considerations.},

abstract={Loss tomography using multicast measurements and using unicast measurements have been investigated separately. In this paper we compare the performance of the two methods on tree structures. We prove identifiability of unicast measurements on tree structures with no degree-2 nodes. To theoretically compare multicast and unicast, we develop an observation model for multicast on trees and derive expressions for calculating the Fisher Information Matrix. We apply optimal experiment design for unicast on trees and develop a simple and insightful solution. Using a packet level simulator, we evaluated and compared the per-link MSE of multicast and unicast under varying parameter settings including link weights, link success rates and tree size. The results show that in contrast to the general belief that multicast always outperforms unicast, unicast can outperform multicast under tight constraint on the probing budget, especially in terms of a weighted average of per-link MSEs. On the other hand, multicast achieves more consistent performance with respect to varying link success rates or tree size.},

In response, there has been extensive research done with behavioral analysis and detection methods using system calls, CPU usage, and anomaly-based detection. In this paper, we extend upon these previous works by using logcat and strace outputs to generate runtime datasets of both malicious and benign applications. Using these datasets, we generate feature sets to be used for classification. We test the effectiveness of both a Random Forest classifier and a Support Vector Machine on this feature set.

pages={336-341}, 
abstract={A multitude of cyber vulnerabilities on the tactical edge arise from the mix of network infrastructure, physical hardware and software, and individual user-behavior. Because of the inherent complexity of socio-technical systems, most models of tactical cyber assurance omit the non-physical influence propagation between mobile systems and users. This omission leads to a question: how can the flow of influence across a network act as a proxy for assessing the propagation of risk? Our contribution toward solving this problem is to introduce a dynamic, adaptive ecosystem-inspired model of vulnerability exploitation and risk flow over a tactical network. This model is based on ecological characteristics of the tactical edge, where the heterogeneous characteristics and behaviors of human-machine systems enhance or degrade mission risk in the tactical environment. Our approach provides an in-depth analysis of vulnerability exploitation propagation and risk flow using a multi-agent epidemic model which incorporates user-behavior and mobility as components of the system. This user-behavior component is expressed as a time-varying parameter driving a multi-agent system. We validate this model by conducting a synthetic battlefield simulation, where performance results depend mainly on the level of functionality of the assets and services. The composite risk score is shown to be proportional to infection rates from the Standard Epidemic Model.},

abstract={Denial of service (DoS) attacks are among the most crippling of network attacks because they are easy to orchestrate and usually cause an immediate shutdown of whatever resource is targeted. Today's intrusion detection systems check if specific single scalar features exceed a threshold to determine if a specific TCP-based DoS attack is underway. To defeat such systems we demonstrate that an attacker can simply launch a combination of attack threads, each of which on its own does not break a system down but together can be very potent. We demonstrate that such attacks cannot be detected by simple threshold based statistical anomaly detection techniques that are used in today's intrusion detection systems. We argue that an effective way to detect such attacks is by jointly considering multiple features that are affected by such attacks. Based on this, we identify a possible set of such features and design a new detection approach that jointly examines these features with regards to whether each exceeds a high threshold or is below a low threshold. We demonstrate that this approach is extremely effective in detecting stealthy DoS attacks; the true positive rate is close to 100 % and the false positive rate is decreased by about 66 % as compared to traditional detectors.},

This allows reboot attacks, where a machine is put in a correct state only when an attestation is going to be performed.

abstract={Radio Frequency RF Distinct Native Attribute (RF-DNA) Fingerprinting is a PHY-based security method that enhances device identification (ID). ZigBee 802.15.4 security is of interest here given its widespread deployment in Critical Infra-structure (CI) applications. RF-DNA features can be numerous, correlated, and noisy. Feature Dimensional Reduction Analysis (DRA) is considered here with a goal of: (1) selecting appropriate features (feature selection) and (2) selecting the appropriate number of features (dimensionality assessment). Five selection methods are considered based on Generalized Relevance Learning Vector Quantization-Improved (GRLVQI) feature relevance ranking, and p-value and test statistic rankings from both the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test and the one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) F-test. Dimensionality assessment is considered using previous qualitative (subjective) methods and quantitative methods developed herein using data covariance matrices and the KS and F-test p-values. ZigBee discrimination (classification and ID verification) is evaluated under varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions for both authorized and unauthorized rogue devices. Test statistic approaches emerge as superior to p-value approaches and offer both higher resolution in selecting features and generally better device discrimination. With appropriate feature selection, using only 16% of the data is shown to achieve better classification performance than when using all of the data. Preliminary first-look results for Z-Wave devices are also presented and shown to be consistent with ZigBee device fingerprinting performance.},

abstract={Access control has been used in many systems such as military systems and business information systems. Access control protects sensitive information based on access control policies. Thus, assuring the correctness of policies is important. For this purpose, many access control policy verification (ACPV) tools have been proposed to check the correctness of policies. Since these tools have been designed by different mechanisms, they have different capabilities and performances. However, there lacks a set of standard approaches for evaluating them. Consequently, it is difficult for users to identify an appropriate tool for verifying their security policies. In this paper, we make an initial step towards building standard approaches for evaluating the capability and performance of ACPV tools. Specifically, we propose a set of reference metrics for analytically evaluating, as well as sets of oracles and test cases for empirically checking the run-time capability and performance of ACPV tools. To demonstrate, we apply these metrics, oracles and test cases on existing ACPV tools.},

abstract={Over the years, web services have become a fundamental part of our daily lives. We do everything on the web, from social to work and personal affairs. The volume of traffic over the web has become large due to the amount of people who use it. Recently, a paradigm for web applications called Single Page Application, has become more popular. With the use of Javascript based technologies, we can run practically any type of application on the client side, and leave the server with the sole duty of serving pages and a manual of the available content and how to use it, allowing the server to handle larger amount of volume. Unfortunately, SPA are also vulnerable to malicious users as most of its functionality is located at the client side. This paper proposed a framework to enhance the existent OAuth support to create a trust and anonymous service, which can help ensure the integrity of the application and the legitimacy of the user. Results show that SPA can not just be secure, but also help with server performance, by decreasing its load at higher traffic.},

abstract={The number of internet connected devices by all accounts is set to increase dramatically in coming years as Internet of Things technologies become cheaper and more convenient. Z-Wave devices have found application in building control, smart energy, health care and equipment monitoring. Its closed standard ensures interoperability of devices and this stability has led to its popularity among consumers. As use of these devices becomes more widespread, the need to protect them becomes more important. In this research, the RF-DNA fingerprinting method is examined to protect these devices using their physical layer attributes. In particular, the traditional method of using parametric features such as variance, skewness, and kurtosis is challenged with the use of non-parametric features mean, median, mode and linear regression coefficient estimates. With careful analysis of variables, a 71% reduction in features is achieved while attaining >94% correct classification rate at an 8 dB lower SNR than using traditional parametric features.},

year={2015}, 
volume={},

pages={383-387}, 
abstract={Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) are sparse mobile ad-hoc networks in which there is typically no complete path between the source and destination. Although many routing algorithms for DTNs have been proposed, prior works generally focus on optimizing delivery ratio and cost by finding the relay node with the highest delivery probability to the destination. In social networks, the connections among nodes, which are established via social contacts, exhibit a fat-tailed distribution in which few nodes have many connections and the majority have very few. Since current heuristic-based routing algorithms bias toward connectivity, highly connected nodes have a high probability to be selected by other nodes as their next hop. As a result, the load distribution becomes significantly unbalanced, with very few nodes handling the majority of message forwardings. In this paper, we provide empirical experiments to show the natural load imbalance of existing routing algorithms. We then introduce Load Balanced Social-Tie Routing (LBR), a routing strategy in which messages are favorably forwarded to network nodes that have both a stronger social tie with the destination and a smaller or similar queue length. This queue length control strategy aims to reduce traffic at highly connected nodes, and allows nodes of similar degrees to trade packet forwardings with each other, thus spreading the traffic more evenly across the network. Through extensive simulation studies using a real-world San Francisco cab trace, we show that LBR can achieve a comparable or better delivery ratio and cost than existing algorithms. Meanwhile, LBR distributes the load more evenly with the top 10% of network nodes handling 23% of the forwardings, compared to 37% for Epidemic routing, 43% for PROPHET, and 47% for BubbleRap.},

abstract={Mobile networks in the military tactical domain, include a range of radio networks with very diverse characteristics and which may be employed differently from operation to operation. When interconnecting networks with dissimilar characteristics (e.g. capacity, range, mobility) a difficult trade-off is to fully utilize the diverse network characteristics while minimizing the cost. To support the ever increasing requirements for future operations it is necessary to provide tools to quickly alter the rule-set during an ongoing operation, due to a change in operation and/or to support different needs. Our contribution is a routing protocol which targets these challenges. We propose an architecture to connect networks with different characteristics. One key point is that low capacity links/networks segments can be included in the heterogeneous network, these segments are protected from overload by controlling where and when signaling/data traffic is sent. The protocol supports traffic policing, including resource reservation. The other key point is the ability to quickly alter the network policy (rules-set) including QoS support during an operation or from operation to operation.},

abstract={Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) has many advantages over other routing protocols for use within MANETs. However, it also has its limitations and cannot easily adapt in real time to the highly dynamic nature of heterogeneous military MANETs. This paper discusses the augmentation of OLSR with a reactive routing algorithm referred to as Priority Aware Dynamic Routing (PADR). PADR along with OLSR forms a hybrid routing approach where routes may be chosen based on metrics that are difficult to account for by proactive routing alone; such as mobility, changing mission needs, dynamic resource allocation, and RF contention. The proposed hybrid approach is designed to operate at the cipher text IP layer and is capable of routing over a single MANET subnet or over multiple heterogeneous subnets.},

abstract={As more and more tactical Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) are deployed at the edge, there is a need to interconnect these heterogeneous MANETs to enable increased connectivity and robust communication services to the war fighters. Traditionally, Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is considered the de facto standard inter-domain routing protocol. It was originally designed for wired networks and does not respond well to the challenges posed by mobile networks. With intermittent wireless links and frequent topology changes in tactical networks, BGP suffers from network partitioning, specifically the traditional Autonomous System (AS) split issue. One option is to re-architect the use of BGP to prevent AS splits as shown in [1]. A more scalable approach is to develop a new inter-domain routing protocol that fundamentally addresses BGP protocol limitations. The InterMR protocol proposed by UCLA dynamically detects and heals network splits. In this paper, we implement, demonstrate and evaluate the performance of interMR for connecting ground tactical MANETs with an airborne backbone. Implementation of the protocol required several design choice and adaptations. We use OPNET to compare the performance of the interMR protocol to a flat OSPF architecture and BGP with virtual routers under various mobility models. We show that InterMR heals network splits and provides a scalable approach for interconnecting MANETs.},

abstract={In spectrum trading, secondary users bid for the spectrum units being made available by primary users. Auction theory has been widely applied to improve spectrum allocation in such spectrum trading scenarios. However, in contrast to reality, most of the research work assume either static user populations or static spectrum supply or both. In this work, we investigate a realistic dynamic auction environment where secondary users with diverse delay bounds arrive dynamically, and spectrum becomes available at random. We propose a priority ranking based online auction mechanism that prevents bidders from gaining advantage by misreporting information. We prove that the proposed auction mechanism is truthful and individual rational. We illustrate the properties of the mechanism in terms of spectrum utilization rate, bidder satisfaction rate, and average bidder utility through extensive simulations.},

abstract={Bandwidth allocation in spectrum-congested wire- less content delivery networks should be performed based on the user's Quality of Experience (QoE). The relationship between QoE and network QoS is context- and user-dependent. We show that modeling the user's QoE introduces additional complexity to the bandwidth allocation problem. While recent research has proposed various ways in which complexity can be reduced, we have observed that the optimality (w.r.t. QoE) of the system is also reduced along with complexity. In this paper, the tradeoff between complexity and optimality is investigated and methods to control the tradeoff are proposed. A bandwidth allocation scheme for three different system objectives, including fairness, is formulated.},

pages={426-431}, 
abstract={The most common way to ensure reliable wireless communications is an efficient frequency allocation plan. However, during rapid deployment missions or rescue operations, one can observe all limitations of traditional approach to spectrum planning. In such scenarios the solution is to use dynamic spectrum access (DSA) technology, which requires operational spectrum environment information and spectrum awareness. In practice, such information can be obtained through the use of cognitive radio (CR) nodes. Assuming that the Mobile Ad hoc Networking (MANET) network is hierarchical and contains a number of cluster heads (CH), the CHs can be used to prepare a Channel Ranking List (CRL) based on spectrum sensing information. CRL is a set of frequencies arranged by CH in a specific order, indicating their usefulness as an alternative channels in case of interference. Unfortunately, the downside of this opportunistic approach is that each CH handles only of its own regular nodes (RN) and itself. It means that any CRL in specific cluster is prepared regardless to the environments of neighboring CHs. To avoid interferences between clusters, CHs should send their CRLs to a network management point, which would enable CRL analysis and coordination. In this paper we focused on the assessment of whether the lack of such coordination has a significant influence on operational capabilities of the CR network and its ability to meet the information exchange requirement, as it is a part of military radio system, and therefore must ensure command services with required quality. To evaluate operational performance of the radio network, we propose to use a command capability factor (C2F).},

abstract={The broadcast nature of mobile wireless networks makes these types of networks more vulnerable to attacks by compromised or malicious nodes in the neighborhood of other nodes. In particular, a control plane attack against MAC layers can disrupt a node's association with its neighbor nodes and thereby cause the node to become isolated from the rest of the network. We focus on three potential MAC layer threat models for a TDMA-based wireless ad-hoc network. To cope with these threat models, two distributed mitigation schemes are proposed and evaluated under practical military network scenarios in terms of network outage, packet drop rate, and throughput. The results show that these mitigation schemes enable the network performance under attack to recover close to the normal operation. The recovery is achieved by filtering out control messages responsible for the MAC attacks with minimal overhead.},

The hybrid model is then tailored to a multi-domain implementation able to securely release information products among a wide variety of security domains. The outcome is the emulation of an accredited multi-level security domain system, which enables a single information domain across all mission partners, including non-military ones.

abstract={As the RF spectrum becomes increasingly congested, localization algorithms which are tolerant of high levels of interference become necessary. A unique opportunity exists to study these issues during any event in a large venue, such as a football game in a large stadium. We report on the development of a RF sensor localization field deployment, LOC-EED, in the football stadium at Georgia Tech as well as a simplified laboratory testbed for controlled experimentation. During football games, cellphones, stadium personnel radios, media organization radios and wireless controlled devices, game official wireless headsets, etc. create an Extreme Emitter Density (EED) background that is a challenge to any algorithm attempting to identify and localize a single emitter. The laboratory testbed and field deployment to study this problem consists of RF sensor nodes (RFSN) using wideband RF digitizers and general purpose processors to sense the RF environment. We are using software radios as an enabling technology for the development of unique cross-layer localization techniques which are typically not realizable on specialized hardware, such as WiFi APs. This paper reports the details of LOC-EED and offers a preliminary analysis of spectrum captures in the 2.4 GHz band during a live football game.

abstract={FPGA fault recovery techniques, such as bitstream scrubbing, are only limited to detecting and correcting soft errors that corrupt the configuration memory. Scrubbing and related techniques cannot detect permanent faults within the FPGA fabric, such as short circuits and open circuits in FPGA transistors that arise from electromigration effects. Several Built-In Self-Test (BIST) techniques have been proposed in the past to detect and isolate such faults. These techniques suffer from routing congestion problems in modern FPGAs that have a large number of logic blocks. This paper presents an improved BIST architecture for all Xilinx 7-Series FPGAs that is scalable to large arrays. The two primary sources of overhead associated with FPGA BIST, the test time and the memory required for storing the BIST configurations, are also reduced when compared to previous FPGA-BIST approaches. The BIST techniques presented here also eliminate the need for using any of the user I/O pins, such as a clock, a reset, and test observation pins; therefore, it is suitable for immediate deployment on any system with Xilinx 7-series FPGAs. With faults detected, isolated, and corrected, the effective MTBF of a system can be extended.},

abstract={In military procurement, Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) are becoming more and more common, with growing adoption of technologies derived from commercial standards. COTS are very appealing as they simplify procurement, allowing rapid deployment and cost savings. On the other hand, COTS usually need to be customized and adapted to the battlefield requirements, especially with respect to security and reliability. When fielding a new COTS technology, harmonization with existing legacy and military-specific solutions needs to be taken into accout. Tactical communications are strongly characterized by the co-existence of COTS-derived solutions and military standards. This allows virtually unlimited degrees of freedom when designing a tactical network and leads to a potentially highly fragmented topology, where different fielded technologies are noninteroperable or poorly integrated. For this reason, an accurate planning and testing of integration prior to fielding are required for heterogeneous networks. In this paper we describe a testbed for tactical communications based on an heterogeneous network, deployed in Livorno (Italy) and created from a cooperation between CSSN ITE, a research center of the Italian Navy, Selex ES and ELMAN. The testbed integrates different architectures not only limited to tactical communications, but also comprising remote sensing devices, networking solutions and specialized software applications. The testbed, also thanks to its location, provides a unique environment to set up relevant test scenarios for maritime and littoral operations. Its architecture is modular for rapid integration of different technologies and centralized management of the experiments, in order to be customizable for different kind of test campaigns.},

abstract={Commercial cellular phones, such as Android-based smart phones, are being introduced into the U.S. military battlefield. The use of such devices in the military contexts, however, often assumes different networking structures (e.g., mobile ad hoc networks) and uses different communication paradigms (e.g., IP multicast) than the commercial deployment. Testing Android-based applications for military scenarios using tethered military radios is laborious and expensive with respect to both time and resources. A laboratory testbed allowing for such testing at high fidelity is therefore much desired at both development and testing stages, prior to actual field tests such as the ongoing Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) events. This paper describes a hybrid emulation testbed approach that enables the creation of a laboratory test environment for testing military applications using both real and emulated Android devices under customizable and repeatable network scenarios. We present multiple approach variations that were designed to overcome the issues and constraints associated with different test needs.},

MATLAB System Generator is used to target a Virtex-6 FPGA on the ML605 Xilinx evaluation board, with an optimized number of board resources utilized. A complex pseudo-noise sequence is used as a preamble for timing. The employed training sequence for frequency synchronization consists of only one pilot symbol, distinguishing this system from most approaches which rely upon multiple pilot symbols. By reducing the number of symbols required for the training period, it is possible to increase throughput. In addition, to ensure that the system has flexibility and is not protocol specific, the system allows for a variable number of FFT sizes and pilot symbol design parameters to be used. Performance of the system is shown to improve over an Additive White Gaussian Noise channel by implementing the design in comparison to not compensating for the distortion.},

We first propose an Interference Cancellation algorithm (IC-algorithm) to extract the mixed weak object signal from the strong jamming. Then, an improved FastICA algorithm with K-means cluster is designed to separate each weak signal from the mixed weak object signal. We verify the proposed method based on several simulations.

The OFDM transmission signal is designed to simultaneously meet radar target detection and communications signal recovery objectives using training and information symbols on different subcarriers. Given a frequency-selective Rayleigh-distributed fading channel, equally powered and equally spaced training symbols across the occupied bandwidth minimize the mean-square error of the channel estimate, which is tied to a lower bound on ergodic channel capacity. We perform a hypothesis test on the resulting channel estimate to detect and locate targets. We examine the performance region of capacity versus probability of detection in an example scenario in which a single stationary target is present.},

abstract={We consider range imaging for coherent MIMO radar, that is, the joint estimation of the channel matrices for all range bins of the radar scene. The fundamental problem is the lack of ideal ambiguity properties of the available waveforms. This is why matched filters are generally suboptimal estimators. Approaches like the instrumental variable filter overcome this problem to a certain extent, but need prior knowledge of the interfering range bins. We take a different approach and show that range imaging can be formulated as a block sparse recovery problem. The block structure arises as the coefficients of the channel matrix of a range bin are either all zero or nonzero. In a second step, high-resolution methods for azimuth estimation can be used. This is in contrast to other sparse recovery approaches in coherent MIMO radar imaging where range, Doppler, and azimuth estimation is performed simultaneously and resolution is limited by coarse grids. We make a first step towards the analysis of sparse recovery based range imaging for coherent MIMO radar by presenting numerical recovery results using iterative algorithms. Our simulation results demonstrate that the channel matrices for all range bins can be estimated reliably, even for a large number of targets.},

abstract={In this paper, a fast and computationally efficient joint presence detection and localization method is proposed for the non-cooperative direct sequence spread spectrum (DS-SS) signals. The method uses spatially distributed wideband sensor array output in a sparse way. It is applicable to long and timely varying spreading coded DS-SS signals. The proposed method uses the linearity of phase response between the cross elements of the spatial covariance matrices (R) along the signal bandwidth. This linearity in frequency domain is also used to estimate the time difference of arrival (TDOA) between sensors for the localization of these signals. A new sparse spatial covariance matrix (R) estimation technique which is called as block of consecutive frequency bins (BCFB) is also proposed. Hence, the computational complexity and data sharing rate between sensors are quite reduced according to the conventional incoherent signal subspace processing (ISSP) method. It is shown in simulations that the proposed BCFB method improves the TDOA estimation performance in low signal to noise ratio (SNR) and it attains to the Cramer Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) with greatly reduced processing time.},

abstract={This paper presents a closed-loop internal adaptive calibration method for wideband digital beam formers in phased array applications. The channels are time aligned and calibrated before beam forming using an internal network for illumination and correction of the elemental electronic channels. This approach lowers the cost of wideband phased arrays by eliminating manual factory tuning. The internal calibration network enables calibration during operation without the implicit electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) concerns of a cooperative radiating source. The approach facilitates correcting for age related changes from the initial factory calibration, and for the inherent factory calibration residual errors. Measured data from an existing 22-phase center elemental digital beam former array was used to evaluate the method. The channel response was extracted and bit error rate (BER) was evaluated using a simulation test bench. The results show two orders of magnitude improvement in BER over a narrow band method based on singular value decomposition.},

abstract={Atmospheric duct is a layer in which propagating signals are refracted back to the surface. In this way, these signals are trapped between surface and duct layer. Thus, atmospheric ducts significantly limit spreading of propagating signals, and provide lower path-loss compared to standard atmosphere even at beyond-Line-of-Sight (b-LoS) ranges. Since duct formation is highly probable in regions with high humidity such as coastal and maritime areas, atmospheric ducts can be used as a communication medium especially for naval beyond-Line-of-Sight (b-LoS) links. Trapping effect of atmospheric ducts provides very narrow angle-of-arrival (AoA) span, thus large planar antenna arrays can be utilized to provide sharp electronically steerable beams. To this end, we propose a limited feedback multi-stage beam-forming method for ducting channels for the first time in the literature. At the end, we present simulation results for the spectral efficiency of ducting channels with the proposed method.},

abstract={Today's wireless systems often require dynamic radiation characteristics such as high directivity, wide steerability, and large bandwidth, which are usually not achievable by single antenna frontends. Phased array technology offers a solution by combining multiple elements together in such a way that their radiation characteristics constructively interfere. Typically, the antenna elements are distributed periodically over lattice grids; however, this can lead to undesirable effects such as scan blindness and surface wave propagation. Instead, randomly distributing the radiators can attain the same performance increases without suffering from the detrimental effects of periodic structures. This work provides an analysis of the array behavior for planar triangular randomly distributed antenna arrays (TRA). A probabilistic theory is presented followed by numerical experiments from both the array factor analysis and Ansys HFSS finite-element simulations.

Instead, only the estimated channel status is known by the transmitters. In this context, a joint optimization of subcarrier pairing and allocation, relay selection and transmit power allocation is formulated in the OFDMA two-way amplify-and-forward relay networks. Moreover, to ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) requirement, the energy consumption must be minimized without compromising the QoS. Therefore, by applying convex optimization techniques, energy efficient algorithms are developed with the objective to minimize the total transmit power while guaranteeing the required data rates. Through simulation studies, energy consumption performance of the systems under the proposed schemes are investigated. It is shown that the proposed scheme can improve the energy consumption performance without scarifying the QoS.},

abstract={Multiple input multiple output-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) is the core technology for the next generation wireless local area network (WLAN). Broader coverage and higher spectral efficiency are the main goals of the next generation WLAN. Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) is a promising way to meet this requirement. In this paper, a novel regularized block diagonalization (RBD) precoded MU-MIMO-OFDM scheme with signal space diversity (SSD) is proposed to improve the performance of MU-MIMO-OFDM scheme on the basis of IEEE 802.11ac standard. The proposed scheme takes advantage of the modulation diversity of rotated constellation, the time-frequency diversity of OFDM and the space diversity of MU-MIMO together. Besides, the RBD precoding not only can reduce the interference from other users, but also can decrease the effect of noise. Simulation results show that the proposed RBD-precoded scheme outperforms the conventional bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) scheme without SSD by 3.0dB signal noise ratio (SNR) gain. What's more, the RBD precoding obtains 1.8dB SNR gain than the block diagonalization (BD) precoding.},

abstract={An energy efficient synchronization method is presented for an OFDM-based Time Division Cooperative Transmission (TDCT) system for the purpose of range extension. The proposed algorithm operates on a novel preamble consisting of two OFDM symbols. In TDCT, copies of the packet are transmitted through different time slots. Exploiting dependence between the synchronization parameters of the different TDCT copies, the approach achieves diversity gain in all estimated synchronization parameters. Since the design and algorithm pertain only to the preamble, the method can be applied to decode-and-forward as well as amplify-and-forward TDCT schemes. This algorithm also offers a significant performance improvement to the single-input-and-single-out (SISO) communication system. Through computer simulation, we show that our novel TDCT approach achieves synchronization in the context of range extension, avoiding the need for more preamble energy.},

abstract={Disguised jamming can be used to disrupt adversary wireless transmission without being noticed. In this paper, a novel nonlinear amplify-and-forward (NAF) jamming scheme is proposed to perform disguised jamming on wireless OFDM transmission, by exploiting the vulnerability of OFDM systems to nonlinear distortion. In the proposed design, the jammer nonlinearly amplifies captured signals and then forwards them to the receiver of the target communication system. Consequently, constellation rotation of the target communication signals, coupled with inter-carrier interference and additional noise, is imposed to the receiver. The OFDM transmission is thus disrupted. As the jamming signals are just a distorted version of the communication signals, which can also be induced by hardware imperfection of the communication system itself, the jamming attack is difficult to detect. Moreover, the proposed jamming scheme requires no information about the communication system and no synchronization to target signals. In addition, it can be easily implemented by analog circuits without any digital signal processing. Simulation results are provided to validate the proposed NAF jamming scheme.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose an out-of-band (OOB) reduction method which incorporates with multipath channel and N-continuous OFDM structure. By exploiting the inevitable guard periods between OFDM symbols, i.e., cyclic prefix (CP), the correction component which maintains symbol continuity is aligned with the CP duration after passing through the multipath channel. Thus, the proposed method enables disturbance-free data subcarriers at the receiver while maintaining the continuity of OFDM symbols. This is achieved by the generalization of conventional N-continuous with using more degrees-of-freedom stemming from the CP duration. As it eliminates the interference on the data symbols caused by the correction term, it yields no modification at OFDM receiver, which makes the proposed scheme backward-compatible to conventional OFDM receivers.},

abstract={The usage of smart devices, such as phones and tablets, is becoming a more integral part of military information systems. The applications running on these systems need to exchange information with services running elsewhere in the information infrastructure. Many of these systems use SOAP Web services as their information exchange interface, but this technology is not natively supported on Android, the most common operating system for smart devices. Android does however have native support for REST, but this is not directly interoperable with SOAP Web services. In this paper we investigate the performance of both SOAP and REST Web services on Android, and find that while REST services consume less power, SOAP Web services give better responsiveness.},

abstract={Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) networks allow opportunistic spectrum access to license exempt secondary nodes. Usually secondary nodes employ a cooperative sensing mechanism to correctly infer spectrum occupancy. However, the possibility of falsification of locally sensed occupancy report, also known as secondary spectrum data falsification (SSDF) can cripple the operation of secondary networks. In this paper, we propose a multivariate Bayesian trust model for secondary nodes in a distributed DSA network. The proposed model accurately incorporates anomalous behavior as well as monitoring uncertainty that might arise from an anomaly detection scheme. We also propose possible extensions to the SSDF attack techniques. Subsequently, we use a machine learning approach to learn the thresholds for classifying nodes as honest or malicious based on their trust values. The threshold based classification is shown to perform well under different path loss environments and with varying degrees of attacks by the malicious nodes. We also show the trust based fusion model can be used by nodes to disregard a node's information while fusing the individual reports. Using the fusion scheme, we report the improvements of cooperative spectrum decisions for various multi-channel SSDF techniques.},

Even worse, administrators are required to adhere to organizational policies, which frequently contain conflicting goals.

In this paper, we present a framework to addresses the challenges facing administrators by using formal argumentation to generate big-picture conclusions regarding the system. Unlike other schemes, argumentation excels in situations where information is incomplete and knowledge is contradictory. To motivate our approach, we detail a scenario inspired by real-world data taken from the U.C. Davis environment.},

The second step is to model defense behavior of defenders utilizing intrusion detection and tolerance strategies to reactively and proactively counter dynamic adversary behavior. We leverage game theory to model attack/defense dynamics with the players being the attackers/defenders, the actions being the attack/defense strategies identified, and the payoff for each outcome being related to system survivability. The 3rd and final step is to identify and apply proper solution techniques that can effectively and efficiently analyze attack/defense dynamics as modeled by game theory for guiding the creation of effective defense strategies for assuring high survivability in military MANETs.

abstract={Greedy users deviate from the IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) standards to unfairly increase their shares of the bandwidth on the expense of other standard-abiding users. The greedy behavior is implemented by modifying the firmware of the network interface card to manipulate the back-off timer. This paper presents a methodology using non cooperative game theory to formulate a countermeasure technique to combat the greedy behavior in ad-hoc networks using proactive routing protocol. The effect of the greedy attack on the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) is evaluated to show the impact of the greedy behavior on the other nodes inside the network. The greedy node attempts to maximize its share of the bandwidth to increase data rate transmitted and to reduce its buffer queues and the need of retransmitting packets due to the unavailability of the bandwidth which will save resources (power and CPU processing) for the greedy node. The algorithm consists of three stages, first is to detect and identify the greedy node, then the greedy node will be temporarily isolated in the second stage. In the third stage, the greedy node will be given a second chance to join the group given that it will follow the standards. The game theory approach will consider all players (nodes) are rationale which will enable each node to review its past decisions and outcomes before making new decision.},

pages={653-658}, 
abstract={Jamming attacks are well-known threats to wireless communications, but on the other hand they provide insights for researchers to design novel approaches to protect wireless communications. In recent years, friendly jamming is used by a number of research works to achieve the wireless medium access control. However, in these works, the friendly jammer relies on bit-level information to distinguish the allies' wireless transmissions from the enemies', which requires the received signals to be processed through demodulation steps and thus introduces a non-trivial reaction time delay for the friendly jammer. This reaction delay is undesirable as the transmissions need to be jammed while they are still on the air. To address this problem, we propose fast friendly jamming, which eliminates the need for demodulation and enables the friendly jammer to verify the received signals directly on the physical layer. We have implemented a prototype of the proposed techniques based on GNURadio and USRP, and performed real-world experiments to validate the proposed techniques. The experiment results show that the proposed techniques reduce the normal reaction delay of the friendly jammer by 81.9%-85.7%, and achieve the accurate distinction between allies' and enemies' transmissions.},

abstract={Software Defined Networking (SDN) has the potential to enable novel security applications that support flexible, on-demand deployment of system elements. It can offer targeted forensic evidence collection and investigation of computer network attacks. Such unique capabilities are instrumental to network intrusion detection that is challenged by large volumes of data and complex network topologies. This paper presents an innovative approach that coordinates distributed network traffic Monitors and attack Correlators supported by Open Virtual Switches (OVS). The Monitors conduct anomaly detection and the Correlators perform deep packet inspection for attack signature recognition. These elements take advantage of complementary views and information availability on both the data and control planes. Moreover, they collaboratively look for network flooding attack signature constituents that possess different characteristics in the level of information abstraction. Therefore, this approach is able to not only quickly raise an alert against potential threats, but also follow it up with careful verification to reduce false alarms. We experiment with this SDN-supported collaborative approach to detect TCP SYN flood attacks on the Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI), a realistic virtual testbed. The response times and detection accuracy, in the context of a small to medium corporate network, have demonstrated its effectiveness and scalability.},

abstract={Wi-Fi network offers an inexpensive and convenient way to access the Internet. It becomes even more important nowadays as we are moving from the traditional computer age to the current mobile devices and Internet-of-Things age. Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) - Pre-shared key (PSK) is the current security standard used to protect small 802.11 wireless networks. Most of the available dictionary password-guessing attacks on WPA2-PSK are based on capturing the four-way handshaking frames between an authorized wireless client and the Access Point (AP). These attacks will fail if an attacker is unable to capture the four-way handshaking frames of a legitimate client. An attacker also can apply an active dictionary attack by sending a pass-phrase to the AP and waiting for the response. However, this attack approach could only achieve a low attack intensity of testing a few pass-phrases per minute. In this paper, we develop a new scheme to speed up the active pass-phrase guessing trials intensity based on two novel ideas: First, the scheme mimics multiple Wi-Fi clients connecting to the AP at the same time-each emulated Wi-Fi client has its own spoofed MAC address; Second, each emulated Wi-Fi client could try many pass-phrases using a single wireless session without the need to pass the 802.11 authentication and association stages for every pass-phrase guess. We have developed a working prototype and our experiments show that the proposed scheme can improve active dictionary pass-phrase guessing speed by 100-fold compared to the traditional single client attack.},

abstract={Dynamic channel assignment algorithms allow wireless nodes to select their communication channels based on the state of the network to reduce interference between the nodes and improve the overall network performance. They have been shown to outperform static channel assignment policies and thus are playing a critical role in Software Defined Networks (SDNs). In this paper, we examine the security of dynamic channel assignment algorithms against stealthy decoy attacks in which the attacker induces channel conflicts on a selective set of edges. When an edge is attacked, the victim nodes search for and switch to a different channel to use, possibly causing their neighbors to switch as well. As the effect of the attack propagates through the network, the performance of the network is severely degraded. The decisions of which edges to attack and what channels to use in creating conflicts are the solutions of various Markov Decision Processes (MDP) problems in which the attacker's goal is to maximize the number of conflicts in the network subject to an attack cost. We apply approximate policy iteration methods to identify suboptimal, albeit efficient, attack policies.

abstract={In this paper, we examine scheduling methods for non-orthogonal resource sharing between device-to-device user equipments (D2D-UEs) and cellular user equipments (C-UEs) in a multi-carrier multi-antenna network. The cellular eNodeB (eNB) allocates a pool of frequency subchannels that may be used autonomously by D2D-UEs for D2D discovery and communication. We then propose to schedule C-UE uplink (UL) transmissions in the same subchannel pool based on a best-effort C-UE-to-D2D-UE interference mitigation method, which does not require knowledge of C-UE-to-D2D-UE cross-channels. The selection criterion is a combination of the number of spatial streams and subchannels as well as transmit power needed by C-UEs to achieve their target data rate. Simulation results show that the proposed scheduling methods allow a larger fraction of C-UEs to achieve their data rate targets without major degradation in the D2D network performance.},

year={2015}, 
volume={},

pages={683-688}, 
abstract={In this paper, we present a new approach that seeks reducing the downlink TBS-index by the LTE-A eNodeB. Our objective is to minimize the total transmitted power based on getting the benefit from available but unused PRBs, while considering the QoS for the UEs and mitigating the interference from adjecent eNodeBs. Most previous studies have not assigned the residual PRBs in the eNodeB to change the MCS order in the context of TB. Also, they have not considered the TBS-index as a constraint. In this paper, we formulate a new downlink assignment problem that takes the TBS-index into account, where the PRBs are selected for each TB based on the total available but unused PRPs and the CQI of each UE. Controlling the TBS-index while increasing the number of PRBs will have an effect on the MCS order, hence reducing the transmitted power with respect to the positions of UEs. The TB corresponding to using one MCS and one CC is implemented to enhance the throughput of a generic system with the SISO mode and the infinite buffer traffic type. The proposed approach consists of two aspects: (1) exploiting the residual PRBs among multiple UEs to reduce the TBS-index, (2) finding the optimal power allocation for each UE regarding the optimal MCS, relating to the required throughput, as well as the current channel state information of each UE. The proposed approach is implemented with a greedy algorithm. A set of comprehensive simulations is conducted. It is shown that our approach has made several improvements to the conventional approaches.},

abstract={This paper proposes a new cross-layer based packet scheduling scheme for multimedia traffic in Long Term Evolution (LTE)/LTE Advanced (LTE-A) network. The effective use of the limited resources still remains a major challenge in mobile networks across the globe. A dynamic user scheduling scheme is very important towards actualizing an effective utilization of the limited available resources in LTE/LTE-A networks without compromise to the Quality of Service (QoS) demands of varying users. Hence, the need for an effective user scheduling algorithm cannot be overemphasized. The aim of this paper is to propose a new scheduling scheme called Channel Aware Queue Aware (CAQA) Scheduler that will provide a good trade-off among QoS, fairness and throughput. The newly proposed scheduler is compared to existing ones through simulations, and various performance indices have been used for evaluation.},

abstract={It has been recognized that effective communications and the ability to share various media are keys to a successful operation in public safety and military applications. LTE (Long Term Evolution) is becoming the most widely deployed broadband communication technology making it the technology of choice for public safety to replace TETRA and similar networks. However, LTE is a cellular network by design in that it has planned and fixed antenna locations, and is connected to a common packet core network. Even though the LTE self-organized operation makes the planning, configuration, management, optimization and healing of the network simpler and faster, LTE networks are not well-suited for the moving cell, particularly to establish the backhaul link among the base stations. In this paper we present a novel concept of enhanced evolved Node B (e2NB) to enable meshing of the neighboring e2NBs and maintain the LTE-compliant communication service with the legacy terminals reusing the LTE air interface while moving. We evaluate the performance of the e2NB in terms of backhaul link performance and end-to-end communication using the OpenAirInterface (OAI) LTE implementation. Emulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach to build a self-organized mesh network over LTE/LTE-A. They also show that LTE quality-of-service requirements can be maintained in multi-hop networks subject to resource allocation across multiple e2NBs.},

abstract={Geographical routing protocols in highly-dynamic aeronautical ad-hoc networks are vulnerable to fake geo-location information as an attack that affects network performance. In this paper, a secure geographical routing protocol, called SAeroRP, for multi-hop routing in a highly dynamic aeronautical ad-hoc network is presented. SAeroRP uses the ground station as a trusted third party for authentication and key transport. SAeroRP requires that air-borne nodes be equipped with a second transceiver with a long range (150 Km) and wide downlink bandwidth for point-to-point communication with the ground station. Each packet used in the protocol is authenticated and encrypted to prevent fake geo-location information. NS3 simulation analysis shows that the packet delivery ratio for the aeronautical routing protocol AeroRP decreased to up to 50%, depending on attack type and number of attackers. On the contrary, the attack has minimal effect on SAeroRP and the packet delivery ratio is almost the same as that without attack.},

pages={726-731}, 
abstract={MANET is seen as a promising technology that helps facilitate range extension in tactical edge networks (TENs) where both realtime broadcast and unicast are critical communications. These services are usually provided by proactive routing protocols with Multipoint Relay (MPR) technology. The standardized MPR selection method produces redundant MPR nodes which can cause repeated transmissions of broadcast traffic in TENs where bandwidth and power are scarce. Efficient minimum MPR set optimization remains a challenge. In addition to MPR selection, network connectivity is another important feature for how to best deploy connected MANETs at the tactical edge and ensure its reliable connectivity. To the best of our knowledge, little research has been done on this front. In this paper, we propose a holistic MPR selection (HMS) strategy that selects nearly-optimized MPR sets for a MANET in a pre-defined area at varying radio transmission ranges. We show through simulations that HMS is very close to the lower bound of the optimal MPR number and reduces over 50% MPRs compared to the greedy heuristic method in most tactical edge scenarios. We introduce a method to arrive at the minimum MPR size for fully covering a pre-defined area with different radio transmission ranges and investigate the relationship of MPR set with network connectivity. We developed the algorithm with simple geometry and found that our MPR comparison results among HMS, the minimum MPR size, and the lower bound of the optimal MPR number deliver radio range boundaries that differentiate three different grades of connectivity. The range boundaries can be used as an advanced feature for how to best deploy a MANET at the tactical edge for reliable connectivity.},

abstract={Current evaluations of DoD tactical networking systems have left the impression of sub-optimal performance without being able to provide either a clear vision of the limits on the performance that could realistically be attained or which layers of the network algorithm are responsible for the suboptimal results. Recent advances in computing the capacity of a large MANET allow us to obtain a practical benchmark for MANET capacity performance evaluation [1]. In this paper, we quantify the impact of commonly used algorithms at the routing and the scheduling layers on the overall network throughput and compare their individual effects on overall network throughput performance. We consider the routing and the scheduling layers separately since practical MANET implementations are likely to use a layered architecture even though the joint routing and scheduling algorithm is known to be optimal. Our data shows that a good scheduling algorithm can provide potentially four times the throughput improvement of a good routing algorithm when inter-user interference conforms to an 802.11 type model.},

For the assessment of their performance, knowledge of the 3D propagation channel characteristics, i.e., azimuth and elevation of the multipath components (MPCs) is essential. In this paper, we present first results of a 3D outdoor propagation channel measurement campaign performed in an urban macro-cellular environment. The measurements were performed with a 20 MHz wideband polarimetric MIMO channel sounder centered at 2.53 GHz. At each measurement location, parameters of all MPCs observed were extracted with RIMAX, an iterative maximum likelihood high-resolution algorithm. It was observed that MPCs naturally grouped into clusters. We then present a cluster-based analysis of the propagation channel providing some results of the intra and inter cluster parameters and their relevant statistics. Correlation between all extracted cluster parameters are also provided. Parameters such as elevation and azimuth spread (at the base-station) in this work have been used as input to recent international channel model standardization.},

While prior attempts have been made to perform collaborative autonomy, the high complexity of UA systems in general and the planning in particular, have resulted in centralized solutions that tend to be brittle and lack scalability, or in distributed approaches that incur high overheads and require over-simplifying assumptions. In contrast, we propose an approach that is an inherently scalable (linear in the number of tasks, per UA (parallelizable over the UAs) per update) and performs distributed joint task assignment and trajectory planning using local laws analogous to those in natural processes. More specifically, trajectories are planned using the artificial potential force method, with goals and neighbors modeled as attractive forces and hazards modeled as repulsive forces. Additionally, task assignments are regulated using dynamic “valences” that are associated with the goal positions of trajectory planning. This approach allows the incorporation of dynamics and feedback laws to guarantee equilibrium stability. When applied to a scenario of simulated communication networking in harsh environment, our results show that NICiTA is able to build a relay UA data network that has near perfect data-delivery ratio despite the presence of a nearby interferer.},

abstract={Joint Aerial Layered Network (JALN) could provide crucial communication links when milsatcoms are degraded, or lost. In order to effectively evaluate the network performance of JALN, the Joint Assessment Research/ Reference Testbed (JART) modeling of the JALN consists of a scoping model GCM and high fidelity EMANE model. The scoping model GCM performs a coarse analysis of network performance, and provides the network configurations for EMANE. However, there still exist some gaps that the GCM cannot provide all required configurations for EMANE. For example, how can we assign the antennas to JALN High Capacity Backbone (HCB) links where each JALN aircraft has four mounting points for directional antennas? The goal of this work is to develop an optimal antenna assignment algorithm for JALN HCB. Since link availability is the most important metric for JALN HCB, the antenna assignment can be formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem where the objective function is to maximize the link availability of the worst link or to achieve the max-min fairness. Due to NP-hardness of MILP problem, a greedy algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. The obtained antenna assignment can be used as the configuration for EMANE. Numerical experiments are used to show the performance of the MILP and greedy methods.},

This system draws upon inspirations from biological cell differentiation through hormone based communication to coordinate a swarm of airborne nodes in a distributed manner by mapping the radio signals into digital hormones. BioAIR offers three primary capabilities, namely collaborative communication, sensing and navigation. BioAIR performs collaborative communication by autonomously creating a mobile ad-hoc network. This network connects several designated nodes by strategically positioning other nodes based on the desired communication signal quality between them. BioAIR performs collaborative sensing by autonomously reinforcing critical locations based on network traffic, detecting any damage to the formed network, and self-repairing. Additionally, BioAIR can coordinate the sensing effort of possibly heterogeneous sensors distributed amongst all nodes in the network to form a distributed sensor network. BioAIR performs collaborative navigation by following the motion of designated nodes while maintaining the formed communication network, provided that the nodes can react fast enough.},

abstract={The Bio-inspired Autonomous Infrastructure Monitoring (BioAIM) system detects anomalous behavior during the deployment and maintenance of a wireless communication network formed autonomously by unmanned airborne nodes. A node may experience anomalous or unexpected behavior in the presence of hardware/software faults/failures, or external influence (e.g. natural weather phenomena, enemy threats). This system autonomously detects, reasons with (e.g. differentiates an anomaly from natural interference), and alerts a human operator of anomalies at runtime via a communication network formed by the Bio-inspired Artificial Intelligence Reconfiguration (BioAIR) system. In particular, BioAIM learns and builds a prediction model which describes how data from relevant sensors should change when a behavior executes under normal circumstances. Surprises occur when there are discrepancies between what is predicted and what is observed. BioAIM identifies a dynamic set of states from the prediction model and learns a structured model similar to a Markov Chain in order to quantify the magnitude of a surprise or divergence from the norm using a special similarity metric. While in operation BioAIM monitors the sensor data by testing the applicable models for each valid behavior at regular time intervals, and informs the operator when a similarity metric deviates from the acceptable threshold.},

abstract={Airborne network plays an important role in operations of Air Force. Due to the rapidly-changing topologies, limited wireless communication spectrum, latency, and priorities of tasks, it is vitally important to have dynamic spectrum management between aircrafts and base station in airborne networks. Particularly, we encounter two major challenges: (1) uncertainty about channel quality, in terms of the long-term channel statistics and real-time channel states; (2) the dynamics and the possibly correlated nature of channel quality of different aircrafts. To address these two challenges, we propose a distributed framework for spectrum management in airborne networks, which includes: 1) channel quality prediction based on correlation of channel quality among aircrafts; 2) task scheduling in the aircraft. With real-world trace data, we conduct extensive experiments. Our simulation results show that our design can effectively optimize the channel utilization in airborne network.},

abstract={This paper considers the problem of tracking a dynamic sparse channel in a broadband wireless communication system. A probabilistic signal model is firstly proposed to describe the special features of temporal correlations of dynamic sparse channels: path delays change slowly over time, while path gains evolve faster. Based on such temporal correlations, we then propose the differential orthogonal matching pursuit (D-OMP) algorithm to track a dynamic sparse channel in a sequential way by updating the small channel variation over time. Compared with other channel tracking algorithms, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed D-OMP algorithm can track dynamic sparse channels faster with improved accuracy.},

abstract={Accurate channel estimation is essential for time domain synchronous OFDM (TDS-OFDM), which is a key enabling technology in digital terrestrial multimedia broadcasting (DTMB) standard. However, conventional channel estimation schemes for TDS-OFDM systems suffer from the obvious performance loss in high-speed scenarios. In this paper, by exploiting the temporal correlation of wireless channels, we propose a sparse channel estimation scheme to improve the channel estimation performance for TDS-OFDM systems in high-speed scenarios. Specifically, we first propose an overlap-add method of the received time-domain training sequences (TSs) to acquire the rough channel estimation, whereby the temporal correlation of wireless channels is exploited to improve the estimation performance of time-varying channels. Then, a priori information aided matching pursuit (PIA-MP) algorithm is proposed to acquire the accurate channel estimation with low complexity, whereby the priori information from the rough channel estimation is utilized to further improve the channel estimation accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is superior to the state-of-the-art schemes in high-speed scenarios, especially under severe multipath channels with long delay spread.},

abstract={Turbo equalization is an iterative approach to perform joint equalization and decoding of data, which is protected by error correction code and transmitted over intersymbol interference (ISI) channels. Turbo equalization for Reed Solomon (RS) code, which is a popular error-correction code in wireless communication and recording systems, is seldom discussed in the literature. In this paper, we investigate the computational complexity and performance of turbo equalization which exploits three different kinds of equalization algorithms, i.e., BCJR, M-BCJR and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) algorithms. An adaptive belief propagation (ABP) algorithm is used for the decoding of RS code. Simulation results show that, the complexities of the LMMSE and M-BCJR based equalizers are much lower than that of the BCJR based equalizer, and at the same time the performance loss is still acceptable.},

abstract={Continuous phase modulation (CPM) is a family of bandwidth-efficient signaling schemes with memory. In this paper we introduce a simulation-based method to compute a lower bound, namely the dependence testing (DT) bound, on the maximum achievable rate of general CPM schemes under finite blocklength, probability of error, and equiprobable input distribution constraints. The proposed method utilizes a posteriori probabilities (APPs) of the state transitions on the trellis that models the CPM modulator. The bound on the maximum achievable rate is then used to lower bound the spectral efficiency of CPM schemes under the finite blocklength constraint. For the numerical results, we focus on minimum-shift keying (MSK) modulation, and compute the DT bound for MSK as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We simulate a serially concatenated convolutional code (SCCC) using MSK as the inner code, which performs within 1.1 dB of the DT bound theoretical curve for various coding rates.},

abstract={Golay complementary code pairs have the advantage of being biphase, available at a variety of lengths as long as desired, with complete sidelobe cancellation. But, they have the disadvantage of requiring two frequencies/channels with the possibility of inexact sidelobe cancellation due to frequency selective fading. In this paper, the complementary code pair are transmitted at the same frequency band, while maintaining exact sidelobe cancellation by using linear frequency modulated (LFM) chips with mirror image symmetry. One code uses a LFM chip with rising frequency sweep, while the other uses its mirror image with decreasing frequency sweep. These two LFM chips have identical autocorrelations due to their mirror image symmetry. Therefore, addition of the matched filter outputs of the two codes results in exact sidelobe cancellation. These LFM chips are quasi-orthogonal in the convolution sense due to their symmetry. This results in small cross-correlation sidelobes outside the zero-sidelobe region. Since the complementary code pair share the same bandwidth and are symmetric, frequency selective fading does not change the symmetry property and therefore, does not affect sidelobe cancellation.},

abstract={The authors present an efficient signal processing algorithm for implementing a full digital multicarrier frequency hopping (MCFH) receiver. FH radios were, at the beginning, developed for military applications because of their characteristic of being highly jamming resistant. The proposed receiver architecture is based on non-maximally decimated filter bank (NMDFB) also known as polyphase channelizer which enables the functionality of simultaneously de-hopping multiple frequency-hopped spread spectrum (FHSS) signals at reduced sample rate. This feature greatly reduces the implementation cost as well as power consumption of a traditional analog based de-hopping circuit. Furthermore, the NMDFB based de-hopping circuit supports fast acquisition by means of conducting parallel search, which gives a much shortened synchronization time. After de-hopping, second tier NMDFBs are used as a bank of band pass filters (BPFs) to perform non coherent demodulation of the underlying M-ary frequency shift keying (MFSK) signal.},

abstract={Frequency hopping (FH) is a spread spectrum transmission technique that achieves frequency diversity gain over frequency selective fading channels and also has a low probability of interception. This technique has been widely used in military applications, for its recognized anti-jamming performance, and in some wireless standards such as GSM and Bluetooth, for its interference resistance. Modern FH systems employ partial digital technology and their performance depends on the hopping bandwidth. The wider is the hopping bandwidth the greater is the performance. The width of the hopping bandwidth is one of the factors that limits the usage of fully digital technology for FH systems. In [7] we proposed a fully digital FH architecture based on polyphase channelizers. In this paper, we extend the proposed transmitting architecture to a multi-carrier frequency hopping (MCFH) system. The proposed structure is composed of a cascade of two polyphase up converter channelizers. The first one performs the M-FSK (or BFSK) modulation while the second one accomplishes the task of hopping the modulated spectra independently over L subcarriers under the control of pseudorandom sequence generators. In this paper, both theoretical aspects and simulation results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed fully digital structure, are provided.},

The multinet capability of JTIDS enables concurrent operations in battle fields by allowing simultaneous data transmission and reception. PCCSK is a spread spectrum technique that supports various data rates and improves the data rate of JTIDS. The existing approach to PCCSK employs Reed Solomon (RS) code selection, and allows the dissemination of multiple access interference from the contaminated pulse to other pulses, and degrades the multinet capability. To prevent this error propagation, the proposed code selection approach restricts the RS symbol to be transmitted within one pulse. Simulation results show that the waveforms obtained using the proposed scheme outperform the previous waveforms including the JTIDS waveform with respect to both the multinet capability and the data rate.},

abstract={A common jamming strategy against frequency-hopping (FH) radio networks is to adopt follower jamming. A possible counteraction of the radio network to aggravate for the jammer is to utilize a pseudo-random dwell-time in the FH process. The paper provides a method to analyze the performance of a frequency-hopping ad hoc network under follower jamming, and a jamming criterion for FH with a pseudo-random dwell-time is derived. For the assessment a network scenario is utilized. When links are jammed, even if the network still is connected, the capacity of the network is affected. Also, at low hop rates when a large part of the links is jammed, many of the network nodes can communicate with each other. This is because a number of strong links exist with a power advantage over the jammer. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that a considerably lower average hop rate can be used when the network is equipped with a FH radio with a pseudo-random dwell-time instead of a fixed dwell-time.},

abstract={This paper proposes a methodology for optimizing a frequency-hopping network that uses continuous-phase frequency-shift keying and adaptive capacity-approaching channel coding. The optimization takes into account the spatial distribution of the interfering mobiles, Nakagami fading, and lognormal shadowing. It includes the effects of both co-channel interference and adjacent-channel interference, which arises due to spectral-splatter effects. The average network performance depends on the choice of the modulation index, the number of frequency-hopping channels, and the fractional in-band power, which are assumed to be fixed network parameters. The performance of a given transmission depends on the code rate, which is adapted in response to the expected interference to meet a constraint on outage probability. The optimization proceeds by choosing a set of fixed network parameters, drawing the interferers from the spatial distribution, and determining the maximum rate that satisfies the outage constraint. The process is repeated for a large number of network realizations, and the fixed network parameters that maximize the area spectral efficiency are identified.},

In this paper, we present results on the maximum information rate (denoted as “capacity” hereafter) of MIMO transmission with LR-aided equalizers employed at the receiver. First, we derive the main steps for calculating the capacity with different equalizers. Then, we illustrate the capacity when LR-aided equalizers are adopted. We show that the capacity gap between maximum likelihood equalizer (MLE) and LR-aided LEs is linked to the orthogonality deficiency (od) of the dual of the lattice-reduced channel matrix. Although LR-aided LEs do not guarantee to improve capacity every channel realization, we give the conditions when the ergodic capacity of LR-aided LEs is greater than that of LEs, as well as when their outage diversity is the same as that of MLE. Lastly, we show numerical examples with several state-of-the-art LR algorithms to corroborate the theoretical analysis.},

abstract={Full-duplex multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) relaying is capable of providing coverage for remote users with low power consumption, by exploiting the spatial dimensions of MIMO to suppress different types of interference, including self interference (SI) and multi-user interference (MUI). In a general network with multiple full-duplex MIMO relays, inter-relay interference (IRI) emerges and degrades system performance by consuming excessive transmit power. In this paper, distributed beamforming is investigated for interference suppression in multiple full-duplex MIMO relay network. Based on successive convex approximation and proximal point method, a distributed beamforming algorithm is proposed to suppress the three types of interference jointly, with the target of minimizing total transmit power under individual user rate constraints. The proposed iterative algorithm requires only local information exchange at the relays, which reduces the signaling overhead in largescale networks. An upper bound of the stepsizes that guarantee convergence is also given. Simulation results are presented to validate effectiveness of our proposal.},

abstract={Energy-efficient transmission of battery-powered devices is becoming more important in the mobile industry to improve device communications times on a battery charge. In this paper, we present a method to maximize energy efficiency (EE) at the mobile station transmitter for a packet-based multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) system. The system leverages channel state information for energy-efficient transmission with linear precoding. Methods and simulation results show that the solution of maximizing transmit energy efficiency depends on various factors such as transmit power, modulations, packet length, linear prccoding schemes and channel realizations.},

abstract={An accurate estimation of the transmit-antenna number is a prerequisite for blind signal detection in non-collaborated multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. This paper proposes a Wishart-matrix's largest eigenvalue (WME) based hypothesis testing algorithm for blind detecting the transmit-antenna number. By introducing the Random Matrix Theory (RMT), we can get a precise distribution of the Wishart matrix's largest eigenvalue. With this distribution, we can achieve a threshold which leads to a reliable estimation. A series of simulations show that under a wide range of conditions the proposed WME algorithm is superior over the algorithms based on Akaike information criterion (AIC), minimum description length (MDL) and predicted eigen-threshold (PET).},

abstract={This paper examines network-centric warfare (NCW) penetration within the U.S. Army. NCW was intended to be an emerging theory of war for the information age. It was supposed to provide a conceptual framework that would prevent new technology enabled approaches to warfare from being constrained by outmoded ideas. A thematic analysis of the literature was performed using NVivo 10, a computer assisted qualitative data analysis software, to assess NCW adoption within the U.S. Army. The data did not support the idea that it has been adopted. A lack of adoption can result in limitations on the ability of today's soldiers to take advantage of the enhanced approaches to warfare offered by the theory. U.S. Army leaders should adopt NCW so that they have a theoretical framework for the conduct of military operations in an information rich environment.},

abstract={Situational awareness supports mission assurance and requires access to archived and real-time information that is most relevant to the mission being performed, the roles of warfighters, and evolving operational scenarios. Information Management (IM) services support the discovery, brokering, and dissemination of past and future information in support of military missions. They decouple information providers from information consumers as they discover and disseminate information based on information attributes and consumer interests, no matter where, when, or how that information has become available. However, setting up the requests (i.e., subscriptions and queries) to provide situation awareness can be a complex task that requires significant time, expertise, and patience. This paper describes Adaptive Mission Templates (AMT), a prototype graphical environment for defining the information needs of operational missions; generating requests for information, including requests based on dynamic mission context; and specifying the prioritization of information based on mission needs and context. The AMT software has been demonstrated on US Air Force mission scenarios to generate requests and policies enforced by an Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) information broker.},

abstract={Selective forwarding attack is one of well-known denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and designing its countermeasure is critical and challenging. Detecting a forwarding misbehavior in multi-hop networks is non-trivial because it is hard to filter from node failure or packet collision. This paper proposes a new countermeasure, called camouflage-based active detection, in a rapidly emerging energy harvesting motivated networks (EHNets), where a set of self-sustainable nodes communicate directly or indirectly via multi-hop relays. Four adversarial scenarios motivated by energy harvesting and their potential forwarding vulnerabilities are analyzed. Each node actively disguises itself as an energy harvesting node, monitors any forwarding operation, and detects forwarding misbehaviors of lurk deep malicious nodes in EHNets. Extensive simulation experiments using OMNeT++ show that the proposed approach is highly detection-efficient compared to a hop-by-hop cooperative detection scheme in terms of detection latency and detection rate.},

abstract={In tactical wireless networks, the one-to-multiple communication model is pervasive due to commanding and control requirements in mission operations. In such networks, the roles of nodes are non-homogeneous; i.e., they are not equally important. This, however, opens a door for an adversary to target important nodes in the network by identifying their roles. In this paper, we investigate an important open question: how to detect and conceal the roles of nodes in tactical wireless networks? Answers to this question are of essential importance to understand how to identify critical roles and prevent them from being the primary targets. We demonstrate via analysis and simulations that it is feasible and even accurate to identify critical roles of nodes by looking at network traffic patterns. To provide countermeasures against role detection, we propose role concealment methods based on proactive network strategies. We use simulations to evaluate the effectiveness and costs of the role concealment methods.},

abstract={In current enterprise environments, information is becoming more readily accessible across a wide range of interconnected systems. However, trustworthiness of documents and actors is not explicitly measured, leaving actors unaware of how latest security events may have impacted the trustworthiness of the information being used and the actors involved. This leads to situations where information producers give documents to consumers they should not trust and consumers use information from non-reputable documents or producers. The concepts and technologies developed as part of the Behavior-Based Access Control (BBAC) effort strive to overcome these limitations by means of performing accurate calculations of trustworthiness of actors, e.g., behavior and usage patterns, as well as documents, e.g., provenance and workflow data dependencies. BBAC analyses a wide range of observables for mal-behavior, including network connections, HTTP requests, English text exchanges through emails or chat messages, and edit sequences to documents. The current prototype service strategically combines big data batch processing to train classifiers and real-time stream processing to classifier observed behaviors at multiple layers. To scale up to enterprise regimes, BBAC combines clustering analysis with statistical classification in a way that maintains an adjustable number of classifiers.},

abstract={Location inference attack may cause location privacy leakage of secondary users SUs in database-driven cognitive radio networks. Malicious entities could infer SUs' location with channel usage information. For the unpredictable return of primary users, there is no solution that is effective to location inference attack. To prevent location inference attack, we propose an Agent-based Channel Selection(ACS) scheme in this paper. In this scheme, the database allocates available spectrum with self-coexistence mechanism to avoid interference among SUs, and each base station registers spectrum information as an agent in the database SUs. Thus, the proposed ACS scheme can decrease the probability of being geo-located for SUs effectively. The variation tendency of the average probability of geo-location with different factors is shown in simulation.},

abstract={With Proximity-based Mobile Social Networks (PMSNs), mobile users can discover and make new social interactions easily with physical-proximate others through WiFi/Bluetooth interfaces embedded in the smartphones. Unfortunately, users enjoy these conveniences at the cost of revealing their personal data. Furthermore, an important factor called social strength, which impacts the discovering result a lot, is always ignored. To address these problems, we propose S-match, which aims to achieve secure friend discovery in social strength-aware PMSNs. Specifically, S-match exploits a two-dimensional similarity vector with considering both priority-aware similarity coefficient and social strength-aware similarity coefficient. We construct a similarity evaluation model based on entropy method to measure profile similarity, as well as a novel priority-aware similarity coefficient by improving Jaccard similarity function. Finally, the combination of the homomorphic property and the priority-aware similarity coefficient guarantee the avoidance on the insider attacks. The security and performance are thoroughly analyzed and evaluated via detailed simulations.},

abstract={An analytical framework is presented to integrate link padding mechanisms to the functioning of intermediate relays in anonymous networks such that a desired degree of anonymity- secrecy of source destination pairs- is achieved against timing analysis without adding significant latency. In particular, the relays for routing and the degree of link padding at each relay are chosen to optimize the tradeoff between anonymity from timing analysis, as measured by Shannon entropy of source destination pairs, and the average latency. Optimization of the tradeoff is shown to require exponential complexity, and a suboptimal algorithm is presented that is shown numerically to perform close to the optimal, but only requires linear complexity. In addition, an incremental optimization is presented for a new user to be added optimally to an existing system without altering the prevalent routes.},

abstract={Moving Target Defense (MTD) is the concept of controlling change across multiple information system dimensions with the objective of increasing uncertainty and complexity for attackers. Increased uncertainty and complexity will increase the costs of malicious probing and attack efforts and thus prevent or limit network intrusion. As MTD increases complexity of the system for the attacker, the MTD also increases complexity in the desired operation of the system. This introduced complexity results in more difficult network troubleshooting and can cause network degradation or longer network outages. In this research paper the authors describe the defensive work factor concept. Defensive work factors considers in detail the specific impact that the MTD approach has on computing resources and network resources. Measuring impacts on system performance along with identifying how network services (e.g., DHCP, DNS, in-place security mechanisms) are affected by the MTD approach are presented. Also included is a case study of an MTD deployment and the defensive work factor costs. An actual experiment is constructed and metrics are described for the use case.},

pages={972-977}, 
abstract={In most Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications the sensors forward their readings to a central sink or base station (BS). The unique role of the BS makes it a natural target for an adversary's attack. Even if a WSN employs conventional security mechanisms such as encryption and authentication, an adversary may apply traffic analysis techniques to locate the BS. This motivates a significant need for improved BS anonymity to protect the identity, role, and location of the BS. Published anonymity-boosting techniques mainly focus on a single layer of the communication protocol stack and assume that changes in the protocol operation will not be detectable. In fact, existing single-layer techniques may not be able to protect the network if the adversary could guess what anonymity measure is being applied by identifying which layer is being exploited. In this paper we propose combining physical-layer and network-layer techniques to boost the network resilience to anonymity attacks. Our cross-layer approach avoids the shortcomings of the individual single-layer schemes and allows a WSN to effectively mask its behavior and simultaneously misdirect the adversary's attention away from the BS's location. We confirm the effectiveness of our cross-layer anti-traffic analysis measure using simulation.},

abstract={Wireless communication systems are susceptible to jamming attacks, and a large body of research has investigated jamming and anti-jamming strategies for single communication links. However, attacking single links may not be sufficient to disrupt communications in a network, which may route traffic around jammed links. To date, there has been little research on jamming to disrupt an entire network. In this paper, we consider the problem of determining how to efficiently place jammers to minimize the number of jammers needed to disrupt a network by partitioning it into a specified number of disconnected subnetworks, each of which is limited in size. We formulate this problem as an optimal clustering problem on a graph and show that the clustering problem can be solved exactly as a binary integer linear program (ILP). Since the complexity of the ILP increases rapidly with the size of the network, we also solve the ILP via harmony search, a meta-heuristic algorithm. Harmony search offers the ability to tradeoff between complexity and performance. In the scenarios where comparison between the two algorithms is feasible, the harmony search provides close-to-optimal performance with a much lower time complexity.},

abstract={In recent years, there has been a large push in the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to augment ground networks with a high capacity airborne backbone network that uses directional communications technologies. Such a network could supplement the traditional SATCOM infrastructure which can become easily oversubscribed, may be degraded, or may even be unavailable. Although there are several advantages to these high capacity aerial backbone networks, one key challenge is topology formation and maintenance with highly directional links. In this paper, we present an architectural concept and implementation of a flexible topology management (TM) system for topology formation and coordination of aerial high capacity backbone networks. The TM framework is modular and extensible to allow for different algorithms and radio systems to be employed. A simple baseline algorithm is presented that maximizes network connectivity. Performance results from an EMANE/CORE emulation of a simple but representative aerial range extension network show that high link and network availability can potentially be attained by an automated TM architecture in this type of scenario.},

abstract={There has been much work in the open literature on the use of cross-layer information and design to improve overall system performance in wireless networks operating in benign (non-hostile/non-jammed) environments. However, not much work has been devoted to developing a systematic cross-layer framework that lends itself well to housing alternative cross-layer design algorithms for contested networks that are of interest to the Army. In this paper, we describe a flexible, modular and extensible cross-layer framework that can be used both in contested and benign environments to design robust multi-tiered ad hoc communications networks. Our framework is agnostic to the underlying substrate and can be used both on simulation platforms as well as SDR substrates. Using this framework, we also develop a condition-based cross-layer topology control mechanism that provides the ability to create and maintain a robust network amidst hostile network jamming, and present results via discrete event simulations.},

abstract={We present the framework for a heterogeneous internetworking service architecture to provide probabilistic quality of service guarantees to short critical messages prior to transmission. The TCP/IP Internet is not suited to bear mission-critical data across administrative domain boundaries with stringent delivery requirements because Border Gateway Protocol obscures network state information. Critical messaging is useful in both military and civilian networks, and the adoption of an architecture designed for this service will greatly reduce overprovisioning costs. Leveraging software-defined network control concepts, we describe architectural modifications to the Internet to realize this service and discuss several algorithmic techniques to support its operation.},

abstract={Securing Group communications in mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) continues attracting researchers' attentions due to its importance in many critical applications. Yet, the nature lacking a key management center makes it a challenge in terms of group key management problem in MANETs. Although recent advances in certificateless public key cryptography (CL-PKC) shed light on lightweight group key management issues, most of them depend on the bilinear pairing during their operations, which were not suitable for resource constrained nodes in MANETs due to the heavy computation overhead. This paper proposes a Huffman-tree-based pairing free authenticated certificateless group key agreement protocol (HPF-CLGKA) to establishing the group key efficiently. Neither pairing operation nor the signature for authentication is used during the protocol execution, which will cut down the computation overheads greatly. Moreover, the Huffman key tree further minimizes the negotiation rounds and therefore reduces computation and communication costs. Through these measures, group key establishment and rekeying efficiencies are greatly improved.},

abstract={Recognizing the need for a deeper understanding of the interdependence between critical infrastructures, such as the power grid and the communication network, a number of models have been proposed and analyzed in the last few years. However, most of these proposed models are over simplified and fail to capture complex interdependencies that may exist between these critical infrastructures. The recently proposed Implicative Interdependency Model is able to capture these complex interdependencies involving conjunctive and disjunctive relationships to overcome most of these limitations. Due to the existing interdependencies between the power and communication networks, a failure involving a small set of power and/or communication network entities can trigger a cascading event, resulting in the failure of a much larger set of entities through the cascading failure process. This implies that an adversary with an intent of destroying a specific set of entities E' (real targets), no longer needs to make an effort to destroy E' directly, but instead identify a set of smaller entities E" (pseudo targets), whose destruction eventually leads to the destruction of the real target set E' due to the cascading failure process. A clever adversary will thus try to identify the smallest set of pseudo target entities E00, whose destruction eventually destroys E'. We refer to this problem as the Smallest Pseudo Target Set Identification Problem (SPTSIP). We divide the problem into four classes, and show that it is solvable in polynomial time for one class, and is NP-complete for others. We provide an approximation algorithm for the second class, and for the most general class, we provide an optimal solution using ILP, and a heuristic solution. We evaluate the efficacy of our heuristic using power and communication network data of Maricopa County, Arizona. The experiments show that our heuristic almost always produces near optimal results.},

abstract={In this paper, we introduce a new strategy of using VANET nodes with visual sensors and wireless transceivers to build an instant camera barrier for a given mission period. Given a set of properly equipped VANET nodes whose drivers voluntarily join the protocol by exposing their future travel plans and use onboard equipment to transmit realtime video to the authority, we aim to maintain the barrier of VANET nodes during a given mission period. Under the constraints that the mobility of each VANET node is not controllable and the size of barrier, i.e. the number of concurrent participants, cannot exceed a given number due to the network system capacity limit, we propose a polynomial time algorithm for the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider the construction of camera barriers in pure mobile camera sensor network.},

abstract={Assigning unique consecutive numerical identifiers (IDs) to the nodes of a multi-hop wireless network is an important problem, as it enables critical functions such as resource distribution (e.g., TDMA time slots) and leader election. If also used as a mean to “shorten” otherwise assigned node IDs node enumeration saves energy and imposes lower complexity. In this paper we present an efficient scheme for enumerating the N nodes of a multi-hop wireless network. Our protocol, called WiEnum for Wireless Enumeration, is distributed and, by means of the sole exchange of packets among neighbors, terminates with each node having a unique ID in the range 1 to N. Through Castalia-based simulations we demonstrate the effectiveness of WiEnum in assigning unique, short IDs by comparing its performance to that of another leading algorithm for ID assignments, termed SIDA. Our results show that, in terms of completion time (i.e., the time it takes till each node gets its unique ID) WiEnum outperforms SIDA, especially in networks with higher number of nodes and density. At the same time, WiEnum keeps energy consumption to levels that are always lower than those of SIDA.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose an algorithm to support distributed mobile sensors to collect data in sensing areas needing to be observed. The algorithm exploits random positions of mobile sensors to measure the area and applies compressive sensing (CS) to reconstruct all sensed data based on a certain number of CS measurements. At a time instant, the sensors add all readings within their sensing range and exchange their accumulative readings to their neighbors within a sensor communication range. Each CS measurement created at a time is a sum of all data measured by a group of connected sensors. We further analyze and formulate expression for power consumption for communications in the network. The measurement matrix, the number of mobile sensors, the sensing range and the communication range are analyzed and suggested for the networks to consume the least power.},

abstract={We consider a single-hop, wireless sensor network (WSN) performing distributed estimation where the fusion center (FC) will collect local binary estimates within a limited collection time over a single transmission channel. We propose a transmission protocol called sensor-censoring random access (SCRA), in which the collection time is divided into frames and only local binary estimates of the observations in a specific range will be sent in a specific frame by using slotted ALOHA. Since we study a WSN with a single transmission channel, during the collection time, the FC will observe idle time slots, successful time slots, and collision time slots. As a result, we derive a collision-aware maximum likelihood estimator and collision-aware type-based estimators at the FC such that the global estimate is computed from not only the successfully received estimates but also idle time slots and collision time slots. The Cramer-Rao lower bound and mean square error of these estimators are evaluated.},

abstract={Tactical networks are highly constrained in communication and computation resources, particularly at the edge. This limitation can be effectively addressed by the emerging technology of mobile micro-clouds (MMCs) that is aimed at providing seamless computing/data access at the edge of such networks. Deployment of MMCs can enable the delivery of critical, timely, and mission relevant situational awareness to end users in highly dynamic environments. Different from traditional clouds, an MMC is smaller and deployed closer to users, typically attached to a fixed or mobile basestation that is deployed in the field. Due to the relatively small coverage area of each basestation, a mobile user may frequently switch across areas covered by different basestations. An important issue therefore is where to place the service so that acceptable service performance can be maintained, while coping with the user and network dynamics. Existing work has considered this problem mainly from a theoretical angle. In this paper, with the aim of pushing the theoretical results one step closer to practice, we study the performance of dynamic service placement using an emulation framework, namely the Common Open Research Emulator (CORE) which embeds the Extendable Mobile Ad-hoc Network Emulator (EMANE). We first present the system architecture used in the emulation. Then, we present the message exchange and control process between different network entities, as well as methods of deciding where to place the services. Finally, we perform emulation using real-world user mobility traces of San Francisco taxis and present the results. The results show several insightful observations in a realistic network setting, such as the impact of randomness and delay on the service placement performance.},

abstract={The dynamic environment of hybrid mobile and fixed wireless networks used in military operations poses significant challenges in the efficient provisioning of software functionality to application clients. With their transient topology, the software services hosted on mobile nodes may become temporarily unavailable or the cost of transferring data across the network may become too high. To address this problem we have designed a placement technique that allows the dynamic repositioning of services within the network as it evolves. The technique repositions services in reaction to changes in network topology as well as in various system properties, such as service dependencies or the workload generated by application clients. In our approach we use a multi-layer model to represent a service-based software system embedded in a network topology. We apply constraint programming and its linear programming relaxation to solve the model to find where best to place or reposition the services. We evaluate the technique in terms of its effectiveness and cost under various simulated operational conditions.},

abstract={Mobile micro-clouds (MMCs), which are small cloud-like infrastructures that can host services for mobile users, provide a promising approach to deliver data and computation to users in low bandwidth/high latency networks. In this work, we take a step towards security-aware service migration for multiple servers for MMC in tactical environments. As a fundamental model, we consider two users sharing a cluster of MMCs and moving between coverage areas of different MMCs according to random walk. We formulate the problem using a finite horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP). Due to the coupling between users due to security (and possibly interference) costs, we observe that the problem is significantly more complex compared with the non-security-aware single user service migration problem studied in the literature, even in the simplest case of two users. Accordingly, we consider efficient control algorithms which aim to minimize time average costs. Particularly, we propose a modified myopic policy which aims to reduce time average costs by steering operation towards settings which would reduce the likelihood of future security cost increases, by proactively keeping the services distant. Our numerical results demonstrate that our modified myopic policy outperforms other policies in terms of average cost for various settings.},

year={2015},

abstract={The phenomenal success of cloud computing has inspired researchers to introduce the concept of a vehicular cloud (VC). In this work we introduce the concept of a military vehicular cloud (MVC) that specializes VCs to low/controlled mobility situations. Specifically, we envision a MVC involving either parked vehicles or vehicles that move in formation so that the relative distance between neighboring vehicles is, essentially, the same. This is a scenario that applies to military units deployed in support of a tactical mission. We anticipate that the vehicles in the MVC are provided with a wireless connection to an (often mobile) access point which, in turn, is connected in some fashion to a central server. A key difference between MVCs and conventional clouds lies, in addition to mobility, in the unpredictable availability of computational resources. As vehicles enter the MVC, new computational resources become available; when vehicles depart, their onboard resources depart as well, creating a volatile environment where ensuring dependability is a major challenge. Our main contribution is to enhance the dependability of MVCs through a family of redundancy-based job assignment strategies that mitigates the effect of resource volatility in MVCs. We offer a theoretical prediction of the mean time to failure (MTTF) of these strategies. Extensive simulations have confirmed the accuracy of our predictions.},

We evaluate the age metric in a realistic wireless system using the open source network emulation tools CORE and EMANE. Our goal is to validate theoretical results on age for a single link across a wide range of system parameters. In addition to verifying existing theoretical results, we go further by adding more theoretical results that better model the emulated system than currently offered in the theory. Our results indicate that the theoretical results are indicative of real world behavior, but we also identify the limitations of the theoretical models and the impact on the emulated age.},

TNM uses some novel techniques to simplify the building of the network model using graph theory constrained by a hierarchical tree which reflects the organisation structure. TNM allows models to be constructed using an Application Programming Interface (API) or a node based User Interface (UI). When the model is constructed, different simulation back-ends can be applied to it. A discrete event simulation and a network emulation back-end are implemented building on top of open source tools. TNM is simple to create models for non technical users. The model can be used to analyse information flows. The same model can be used for a full network emulation. This allows real software and protocols to be tested in a realistic simulated environment. The flexibility of the software allows its use from engineering up to campaign planning.},

Our heterogeneous tactical network consists of Link 16, Link 11, S-Tadil-J, and JREAP links which have line-of-sight wireless, UHF SATCOM and generic IP transports. Under a Navy contract we have developed a centralized network monitoring system, Decoupled TDL, which creates a global network status view which supports our optimization. Since some elements of our network do not provide communication telemetry our optimization engine does not have direct information about these network links. For these unobservable nodes we employ some statistical methods to infer network status and node position and gain a complete (distorted) picture of our heterogeneous wireless network. Unfortunately unobservable nodes are typically the most dynamic (e.g. planes). Also we use a legacy wireless system instead of a network where the researchers are free to modify the system. We use only the configuration parameters available in the fielded legacy system. Our evaluation procedure is also unique since we use two independent simulations, our tactical network under optimization (TNUO) which consists of wireless mobile nodes under random waypoint models with heavy bandwidth requirements and our optimization simulation which models the TNUO. We expect significant network performance improvement over a network configured by operators using the processes currently in place.},

abstract={Current Electronic CounterMeasure (ECM) systems process preprogrammed jamming techniques against radar threats that are captured and identified by Electronic Support Measures (ESM) systems. On the other side, with recent technologies, radar systems become adaptive and intelligent systems that can change their waveforms. Nevertheless, on-going studies in the radar domain have enabled cognition. However, an ECM architecture is yet to be developed for automatically generating effective countermeasures against new, unknown and next-generation radars. To address this need, enabling a cognitive control mechanism in the ECM system is a suitable solution. In this paper, we present an architecture for Cognitive Electronic CounterMeasure (CECM) system. This CECM system assesses the most effective ECM technique against new, unknown and adaptive or cognitive radars. Simulations reveal that CECM system provides accurate mapping performance while providing satisfying generalization for unknown emitters.},

The charrelation matrix not only can be considered as a generalized second-order covariance matrix, but also incorporates higher-order information. It is significant for blind separation problem based on statistic characteristics to extract statistical information. The problem of underdetermined blind identification is converted as a tensor decomposition model. The mixing matrix can be estimated from the rank-1 terms of the tensor decomposition.

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the detection of single-carrier transmission over frequency selective fading channels with symmetric alpha-stable (SαS) noise. To mitigate the effects of the inter-symbol interference (ISI) cased by multi-path propagation and the destructive impulsive noise, a non-linear myriad filter is firstly adopted and an asymptotic statistic method is then introduced for to analyze the output behavior of the myriad filter. It is found that the output noise of myriad filter in our system is asymptotically normal.

abstract={Receiver-improving techniques are important for submarine communication at the LF/VLF bands, due to very demanding reception conditions. At the surface, the interference environment is dominated by the atmospheric noise, which is highly impulsive in character and may impede the reception of the radio signals. To handle the demanding channel and the impulsive interference environment, error correction and an adapted receiver are necessary. In this paper, we propose a log-likelihood ratio (LLR) as soft output from the demodulator suitable for atmospheric noise. The radio system is assumed to use minimum shift keying (MSK) and a low parity density check (LDPC) code. It is shown that the proposed interference-adapted LLR improves the performance substantially in atmospheric noise compared to when the LLR is designed for AWGN. The performance is also compared to a solution, where the soft output from the demodulator is simplified to a limiter, and to a solution when a larger system bandwidth is used in combination with a limiter. It is concluded that the proposed interference-adapted LLR achieves the best performance in the comparison, although the performance could probably be further improved, when compared to the obtained Shannon capacity of this particular interference.},

abstract={Gaussian distribution as a source of additive noise is a wellknown modeling assumption, which lead to important and insightful results on the channel capacity, detection reliability, and estimation accuracy. It is also well-recognized that in many practical settings the Gaussian distribution may not be adequate to model the underlying noise phenomenon, and various non-Gaussian noise models are employed for the design and performance analysis of communication systems. However, existing non-Gaussian noise models can be cumbersome to use as it is difficult to prescribe the model parameters and estimate them prior to signal detection, and hard to perform analysis and optimization of communication systems with realistic channel estimation. With the above challenges in mind, in the first part of our work, we introduce a model for the additive non-Gaussian channel (ANGC) with a focus on simplicity, robustness, and ease of analytical tractability. Specifically, we consider a compound noise distribution that is composed of a conditionally additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and a Gamma distributed noise variance. This model reduces to the traditional AWGN model when the shape parameter of the Gamma distribution tends to infinity, and the detection and estimation performances on ANGC can easily be reduced to their counterparts on the AWGN channel. With this model, we first present the average mutual information when multiple antennas are employed at the transmitter and the receiver. Next, we derive closed-form expressions for the average probability of error for binary and higher-order modulations when the receiver has perfect channel state information. In the second part of our work, we consider noise variance estimation, pilot-assisted channel estimation (PACE), signal detection with PACE, and coded sequence detection with a mismatched decoding metric.},

abstract={Limited wireless spectrum coupled with the need to support co-existence mechanisms call for robust receivers and improved interference management. With a spectrum sharing operating mode, it is hard to model dynamic interference conditions in wireless networks. In the first part of this work, we have introduced an additive non-Gaussian channel (ANGC) model that captures a variety of interference sources, and presented average mutual information and average probability of error expressions when the receiver has perfect channel estimates and no knowledge of the noise statistics. The primary goal of introducing this model is to compactly represent a wide range of non-Gaussian noise sources in a robust and simple manner. As a continuation of that work, in this paper, we consider the problem of noise variance estimation, signal detection with pilot-assisted channel estimation (PACE), and coded sequence detection with a mismatched decoding metric. We derive the joint maximum-likelihood estimates of the Gaussian noise variance and the non-Gaussian parameter, and expressions for the outage probability and the average bit error probability for uncoded binary signaling. We also derive expressions for the average pairwise error probability with coding and PACE on ANGC. Numerical and simulation results are presented to validate the analysis presented in this paper.},

abstract={We employ a four-node network to obtain preliminary comparisons between two forms of network coding when they are used for broadcast distribution of files in tactical packet radio networks. Each of the four nodes in the network has a half-duplex packet radio, and the nodes are connected by radio links that have time-varying fading. We present two methods for network-coded broadcast distribution. One method uses fountain coding and the other employs random linear network coding. Packet-by-packet adaptations of modulation and channel coding are employed to mitigate the effects of fading on the links. Our network-coded distribution methods are able to exploit the broadcast nature of the wireless medium for improved throughput, and they require only a single frequency band that is used for all packet transmissions in the network.},

abstract={The electromagnetic spectrum available for military use is increasingly crowded and scarce. The military must efficiently allocate spectrum by reusing channels to the maximum extent possible, while also limiting the number of channel changes over time for systems that require manual channel configuration. The classic channel assignment problem is often used to provide exact allocation solutions, but solving this combinatorial optimization problem over multiple time steps while considering cumulative co-channel interference constraints is computationally challenging. Using realistic data sets from large U.S. Marine Corps combat scenarios, we illustrate the importance and difficulties of solving this problem. We examine current solution methods and describe their inadequacies when solving larger problem instances. We also provide a list of ideas for future research on how to address this important and timely challenge.},

abstract={As the next generation mobile ad hoc network (MANET) evolves to allow for multiple simultaneous transmissions within one-hop for higher spectral efficiency, the interferences from the peer nodes will pose a challenge to the initial acquisition in the MANET. In this paper, we propose a maximum likelihood (ML) method of initial acquisition of the preamble sequences. Simulations show that this proposed method is robust against the interferences. We also propose to use a pair of Zadoff-Chu (Z-C) sequences as the preamble. By exploiting the unique structure of the Z-C sequences, we can estimate both timing and frequency offsets through two fast Fourier transforms (FFT). The estimation of the channel response and the interference covariance is also obtained as a by-product. Simulation results verified that the presented method is efficient in interference suppression and may allow for dozens of simultaneous transmissions.},

abstract={We address bandwidth and power constrained distributed vector estimation problem in a wireless sensor network where sensors observe a common unknown zero-mean Gaussian random vector with a known covariance matrix. Sensors transmit their quantized and digitally modulated correlated observations to a fusion center (FC), over orthogonal channels subject to fading and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). We assume the FC employs the linear mean square error (LMMSE) estimator to estimate the unknown vector and the WSN is subject to total bandwidth (measured in quantization bits) and total transmit power constraints. We provide an upper bound on the mean square error (MSE) distortion at the FC and investigate the optimal quantization bit and transmit power allocation among sensors such that this bound is minimized. The bound consists of two terms, where the first and second terms, respectively, account for the MSE distortion due to quantization and communication channel errors. Therefore, we find the bit allocation that minimizes the first distortion term. Given the optimal bit allocation, we obtain the power allocation that minimizes the second distortion term. Our simulation results corroborate our analysis and show that our proposed bit and power allocation scheme outperforms uniform bit and power allocation scheme.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel user clustering algorithm for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) considering the channel correlation between users and the channel gain. We also adopt sum-rate maximization approach to find an optimal precoding matrix in the multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) setup after the user clustering. Grouping two users in a single beam to serve users in a non-orthogonal fashion raises multi-user interference (MUI). To tackle this problem, the clustering algorithm considers the channel correlation to select users aligned with same direction. Furthermore, the channel gain is also reflected in the clustering algorithm to enhance signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) inspired by the fact that the optimal precoding matrix is less sensitive to channel direction. Optimization algorithm over the precoding matrix is proposed based on Majorization Minimization (MM) approach for a non-convex objective function. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes comparing with conventional ones through numerical results.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme applicable to the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink broadcast system. An optimal iterative beamforming design is utilized to the NOMA scheme. The weighted sum rate is used as the objective criterion to design the beamforming matrix at the base station (BS). The users in a typical cluster located in the same radiation beam are precoded in the same weighting factors. We propose an algorithm to schedule the users into clusters to achieve a higher sum-rate. The signals of users in one cluster are precoded in the NOMA scheme. The successive interference cancelation (SIC) technique is used at the receiver to extract the desired signal from a superposition signal. To take advantage of the SIC, a power allocation algorithm is proposed to further increase the sum-rate of this system and guarantee the performance of users with the weak channel condition. Numerical results show that the proposed NOMA scheme, together with the beamforming, user scheduling, and power allocation, can significantly improve the system performance.},

The EPS payloads are placed in the Molniya orbits which experience significant Doppler shift. The loop is required to track out the Doppler shift, terminal rate error, and timing error to support high data rates, up to 2.048 Mbps.

abstract={Military communications face increasingly congested environments requiring spectrally efficient approaches capable of contending with many users and interference. We evaluate the over-the-air performance of recently designed minimum total squared correlation (MinTSC) signature sets compared to maximal length pseudorandom binary spreading sequences (m/PN) under a variety of interference conditions. Pre-calculated MinTSC and PN databases feed into a direct sequence Code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) framework capable of emulating a synchronous multi-user scenario. The framework is constructed in GNU radio and implemented on USRP N210 software-defined radios (SDRs). Packet error rate of a data transfer was measured under varying interference conditions. Signature length, interference profile type and interferer power were varied for both MinTSC and PN signature sets. We address transceiver design and implementation challenges including a two-step acquisition and tracking approach to address the difficulties of preamble synchronization. Under single tone (impulse) interference at the center frequency, MinTSC signature sets experience packet errors primarily on the first signature whereas all PN signatures see errors. Under wide-band interference, individual MinTSC signatures perform more uniformly compared to PN. Understanding of this behavior under varying interference provides the warfighter with greater flexibility to adapt to new conditions and can drive assignment of priority data to specific signatures.},

abstract={Fifth-generation cellular networks are expected to exhibit at least three primary physical-layer differences relative to fourth-generation ones: millimeter-wave propagation, antenna-array directionality, and densification of base stations. In this paper, the effects of these differences on the performance of single-carrier frequency-domain multiple-access uplink systems with frequency hopping are assessed. A new analysis, which is much more detailed than any other in the existing literature and accommodates actual base-station topologies, captures the primary features of uplink communications. Distance-dependent power-law, shadowing, and fading models based on millimeter-wave measurements are introduced. The beneficial effects of base-station densification, highly directional sectorization, and frequency hopping are illustrated.},

abstract={Spectrum access is critical to modern military operations. Increasing demand and competition for spectrum is occurring as the spectrum landscape changes. As spectrum operations evolve to become more decentralized, collaborative, adaptive, agile and flexible, new approaches to spectrum operations are needed. This paper proposes Policy-Enhanced Spectrum Operations (PESO) as an approach to increasing automation of the spectrum management lifecycle by applying digital policies to spectrum management systems in support of dynamic, agile, and flexible spectrum access. PESO is developed using the context of Operation Damayan, the HA/DR mission in response to the devastating typhoon that hit the Philippines in November 2013. Analysis of the spectrum operations concepts utilized during the mission is performed and a subset of concepts are extracted and serve as the basis for the implementation of a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstration based on Semantic Web technologies. As part of the design of the PoC, the extracted concepts are formalized as OWL ontologies and SPARQL policies. The demonstration illustrates the workflow for coordination of frequency assignment with the Philippines.},

abstract={Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE), known as privacy-preserving keyword search, allows users to perform keyword search on encrypted data. However, until now there are no practical SSE schemes which can support query-document similarity evaluation and provide top-k retrieval on encrypted cloud data. This problem slows down the process of SSE schemes' application in cloud storage service. In this paper, we propose a server-side similarity evaluation algorithm to realize the sorted search functionality. Based on this, we further propose an entire SSE solution to achieve the goal of privacy-preserving multi-keyword dynamic sorted (MKDS) search functionalities which steps closer to practical deployment. We formally demonstrate the security of our scheme and evaluate the practical performance of our scheme on the real-world dataset.},

pages={1224-1229}, 
abstract={Contemporary cloud environments are built on low-assurance components, so they cannot provide a high level of assurance about the isolation and protection of information. A “multi-level” secure cloud environment thus typically consists of multiple, isolated clouds, each of which handles data of only one security level. Not only are such environments duplicative and costly, data “sharing” must be implemented by massive, wasteful copying of data from low-level domains to high-level domains. The requirements for certifiable, scalable, multi-level cloud security are threefold: 1) To have trusted, high-assurance components available for use in creating a multi-level secure cloud environment; 2) To design a cloud architecture that efficiently uses the high-assurance components in a scalable way, and 3) To compose the secure components within the scalable architecture while still verifiably maintaining the system security properties. This paper introduces a trusted, high-assurance file server and architecture that satisfies all three requirements. The file server is built on mature technology that was previously certified and deployed across domains from TS/SCI to Unclassified and that supports high-performance, low-to-high and high-to-low file sharing with verifiable security.},

abstract={Querying over encrypted data is gaining increasing popularity in cloud based data hosting services. Security and efficiency are recognized as two important and yet conflicting requirements for querying over encrypted data. In this paper we propose an efficient public-key encryption with keyword search scheme (EPEKS for short) that support binary search for inverted index-based encrypted data. First, we describe approaches of constructing a searchable encryption scheme that supports binary search. Second, we present a novel framework for EPEKS, and provide its formal security definitions in terms of IND-PEKS-CKA security and search pattern privacy by modifying Nishioka's security notions [1]. Third, built on the proposed framework, we design a concrete EPEKS scheme based on the groups of prime order. The scheme enjoys strong notions of security, namely statistical IND-PEKS-CKA security and statistical search pattern privacy. Finally, we experimentally evaluate the proposed EPEKS scheme and show that it is significantly more efficient in terms of search over encrypted data than existing search pattern secure PEKS schemes.},

title={Privacy aware incentive mechanism to collect mobile data while preventing duplication}, 
year={2015}, 
volume={},

pages={1242-1247}, 
abstract={The recent technological advances in mobile devices such as smartphones foster a wide variety of emerging applications which consider users as the providers as well as consumers of the highly valuable real world data from the devices. Interestingly enough, many of the existing researches related to this topic implicitly assume that the users will actively provide mobile sensing data to enable the applications without any compensation, which is not necessarily true for many reasons, e.g. extend battery lifetime, improve system performance, etc., and thus many users are rather dormant in practice. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a proper incentive mechanism for the applications to transform the users to be more active so that the applications can collect much-needed high-quality data. One common key challenge to realize the incentive mechanisms is how to preserve the privacy of the users as they will be requested to provide possibly-privacy-invasive mobile data. An anonymous identity and pseudonym based scheme is a straightforward and easy-to-adopt solution to address this issue. Unfortunately, this approach makes it extremely difficult or inefficient to detect duplicated sensing data from greedy users hoping to get more incentive with the state-of-art strategies. The duplicate data can generate lots of noise when the respective application analyzes the data and will cause more cost to operate the application, and therefore is very harmful. This paper proposes a novel privacy-aware mobile incentive scheme of its kind without trusted third party (TTP) in the sense that two different messages, each of which is with the same sensing data, but with different pseudonym, from the same mobile user can be used to recover the private key of the user.},

The high efficiency of the proposed method is achieved by using a theoretically proved minimum number of backup storage nodes, which is equal to the number of the disks to which access has been lost. The theoretical justification with a methodology of backup codes and their use for data recovery, which is illustrated by examples, is presented. The theoretical and experimental effectiveness evaluation of the proposed method is demonstrated as well. The proposed method is aimed to ensure a high level of survivability of system of distributed data storage for military applications.},

abstract={Modern critical systems are facing an increasingly number of new security risks. Nowadays, the extensive use of third-party components and tools during design, and the massive outsourcing overseas of the implementation and integration of systems parts, augment the chances for the introduction of malicious system alterations along the development lifecycle. In addition, the growing dominance of monocultures in the cyberspace, comprising collections of identical interconnected computer platforms, leads to systems that are subject to the same vulnerabilities and attacks. This is especially important for cyber-physical systems, which interconnect cyberspace with computing resources and physical processes. The application of concepts and principles from design diversity to the development and operation of critical systems can help palliate these emerging security challenges. This paper defines and analyzes models of fault tolerant architectures for secure systems that rely on the use of design diversity. The models are built using minimal extensions to classical architectures according to a set of defined failure classes for secure services. A number of metrics are provided to quantify fault tolerance and performance as a function of design diversity. The architectures are analyzed with respect to the design diversity, and compared based on the undetected failure probability, the number of tolerated and detected failures, and the performance delay.},

abstract={Under the Cyber Army Modeling and Simulation (CyAMS) program, a model validation was conducted using data from an emulated network for malware propagation to compare against the CyAMS finite state representation of network nodes and processes using behavioral simulation. During the validation process, the finite state machine model was effective in identifying important caveats in the emulation tests. Once the experimental parameters were correctly defined, the CyAMS model and the emulated networks showed similar outcomes. The simulation in this case utilized at most 3 CPU cores, whereas the emulation approach required roughly 2,000 real computers and 14,800 virtual machines. The results highlight the possibility that simulation methods can be as effective as emulation test beds in selected cases. Further, simulation results can be an effective tool to verify the goals of emulation based experiments in some cases. Results demonstrated that several orders of magnitude of less computing resources are required for a simulation compared to emulation for this particular test case.},

abstract={The Services have become increasingly dependent on their tactical networks for mission command functions, situational awareness, and target engagements (terminal weapon guidance). While the network brings an unprecedented ability to project force by all echelons in a mission context, it also brings the increased risk of cyber-attack on the mission operation. With both this network use and vulnerability in mind, it is necessary to test new systems (and networked Systems of Systems (SoS)) in a cyber-vulnerable network context. A new test technology, Distributed-StealthNet (D-SN), has been created by the Department of Defense Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) to support SoS testing with cyber-attacks against mission threads. D-SN is a simulation/emulation based virtual environment that can provide a representation of a full scale tactical network deployment (both Radio Frequency (RF) segments and wired networks at command posts). D-SN has models of real world cyber threats that affect live tactical systems and networks. D-SN can be integrated with live mission Command and Control (C2) hardware and then a series of cyber-attacks using these threat models can be launched against the virtual network and the live hardware to determine the SoS's resiliency to sustain the tactical mission. This paper describes this new capability and the new technologies developed to support this capability.},

Traditional digital forensics, such as investigating non-volatile storage, cannot be used to establish the current state of the system (including network connections) or for analysis of malwares that use evasion techniques like encryption. Accurate activities of a program can only be analyzed when it is loaded in memory for execution, for which volatile memory forensics analysis is used. The success of memory forensics depends on the accuracy and completeness of memory image, which means all sections of memory (both kernel and user space) must be captured accurately. Several tools with varied capabilities and accuracies are available for capturing the memory. In order to determine the capabilities and accuracy of Windows volatile memory capturing tools, we have analyzed several different Windows volatile memory acquisition tools and have also compared their results. For analysis of captured memory, we used three different memory analysis tools. The resulting comparisons can be used by investigators to select tools as per their need.},

abstract={Modern vehicles are being equipped with advanced sensing and communication technologies, which enable them to connect to surrounding entities. In military vehicular networks, it is vital to prevent adversaries from manipulating critical messages via cryptographic protection (e.g., digital signatures) and at the same time to minimize the impact introduced by crypto operations (e.g., delay). Hence, their communication must be delay-aware, scalable and secure. In this paper, we developed Hardware-Accelerated Authentication (HAA) that enables practical realization of delay-aware signatures for vehicular networks. Specifically, we developed a cryptographic hardware-acceleration framework for Rapid Authentication (RA) [1], which is a delay-aware offline-online signature scheme for command and control systems. We showed that HAA can significantly improve the performance of offline-online constructions under high message throughput, which is an important property for vehicular networks. HAA-2048 (GPU) is ×18, ×6, and ×3 times faster than the current CPU implementation of RSA, ECDSA and RA, respectively, for the same level of security.},

abstract={Keystroke dynamics is a form of behavioral biometrics that can be used for continuous authentication of computer users. Many classifiers have been proposed for the analysis of acquired user patterns and verification of users at computer terminals. The underlying machine learning methods that use Gaussian density estimator for outlier detection typically assume that the digraph patterns in keystroke data are generated from a single Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we relax this assumption by allowing digraphs to fit more than one distribution via the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). We have conducted an experiment with a public data set collected in a controlled environment. Out of 30 users with dynamic text, we obtain 0.08% Equal Error Rate (EER) with 2 components by using GMM, while pure Gaussian yields 1.3% EER for the same data set (an improvement of EER by 93.8%). Our results show that GMM can recognize keystroke dynamics more precisely and authenticate users with higher confidence level.},

abstract={With the increased popularity of smart phones, there is a greater need to have a robust authentication mechanism that handles various security threats and privacy leakages effectively. This paper studies continuous authentication for touch interface based mobile devices. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based behavioral template training approach is presented, which does not require training data from other subjects other than the owner of the mobile device and can get updated with new data over time. The gesture patterns of the user are modeled from multiple sensors - touch, accelerometer and gyroscope data using a continuous left-right HMM. The approach models the tap and stroke patterns of a user since these are the basic and most frequently used interactions on a mobile device. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method a new data set has been created from 42 users who interacted with off-the-shelf applications on their smart phones. Results show that the performance of the proposed approach is promising and potentially better than other state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract={Personal identification numbers (PIN) and unlock patterns are highly popular authentication mechanisms on smart mobile devices but they are not sufficiently secure. PIN or pattern mechanisms enhanced by additional, implicit behavioral biometric authentication can offer stronger authentication assurance while preserving usability, therefore becoming very attractive. Individual studies on PIN- and pattern-based behavioral biometric authentication on smartphones were conducted but their results cannot be directly compared. In this work, we present a comparison study on the authentication accuracy between PIN-based and pattern-based behavioral biometric authentication using both smartphone and tablet. We developed a uniform framework for both PIN-based and pattern-based schemes and used two representative methods-Histogram and DTW-for user verification. We recruited 15 users and collected behavioral biometric data for both simple and complex PINs and patterns. Our experimental results show that PIN-based and pattern-based behavioral biometric authentication schemes can achieve about the same level of accuracy but not all verification methods are equal. The Histogram method can achieve more consistent results and handle template aging better than the DTW method based on our results. Our findings are expected to shed light on the exploration and analysis of effective behavioral biometric verification methods and facilitate more comprehensive investigation on behavioral biometric authentication for mobile devices.},

abstract={Detecting network anomalies means a lot to network security. In respect of detection precision and range, network-wide anomaly detection approaches on the basis of traffic flows have distinctive advantages over the methods of the traditional host computer, single link and single path. However, these approaches face actual problems of performance reduction or being unavailable when noise interference or data loss take place. In order to solve these problems, anomaly detection algorithm based on robust multivariate probabilistic calibration model is proposed. This algorithm establishes a normal traffic model of traffic matrix based on the latent variable probability model of multivariate t-distribution, and implements network anomaly detection by judging if the sample's Mahalanobis distance exceeds the threshold. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate its robustness and wider use. The algorithm is applicable when dealing with both data integrity and loss. It also has a stronger resistance over noise interference and lower sensitivity to the change of parameters, all of which indicate its performance stability.},

pages={1329-1334}, 
abstract={Link-16 is a widely used tactical data link system for battlefield networks. A key component of Link-16 is network time synchronization. Link-16 provides two types of time synchronization methods: global positioning system (GPS)-based time synchronization and GPS-less time synchronization. In particular, Link-16 requires relay nodes for multi-hop time synchronization. However, in Link-16, the relay nodes are selected statically before the network begins, which inhibits direct communication from incoming nodes; therefore, time synchronization fails. In this paper, we propose a new dynamic relay node selection scheme for multi-hop time synchronization in Link-16. Thus, all nodes can be dynamically identified as relay nodes for new incoming nodes. Consequently, if a new incoming node connects to any registered node, time synchronization can be achieved. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms Link-16, regardless of the number of round trip time slots or the failure probability.},

pages={1335-1340}, 
abstract={Many real-time decision support and sensing applications can be expressed as continuous stream queries over time-varying data streams, following a data stream management model. We consider the problem of the efficient and resilient execution of continuous stream queries in tactical edge networks formed from mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) with limited backend connectivity. Previous approaches for distributed stream query execution target data center environments in which networks are static, and centralized control is feasible. The distributed, bandwidth-constrained and highly dynamic nature of MANETs render such approaches insufficient-while a stream query executes in a MANET, changes in the network topology mean that any fixed query plan eventually becomes outdated. We introduce an adaptive, network-aware approach for stream query planning in MANETs, which supports both single- and multi-input windowed stream query operators. The basic idea is to increase the path diversity available when executing stream queries by replicating query operators across many nodes in the MANET. During execution, it becomes possible to dynamically switch between different operator replicas based on connectivity and other network path conditions. We evaluate our approach in emulated MANETs, showing that it can increase substantially the robustness of distributed stream query processing under mobility.},

volume={},

pages={1341-1347}, 
abstract={Network services often depend on other services distributed throughout a network to function correctly. If a service fails, is disrupted, or is degraded, it is likely to impair other services. The web of dependencies can be surprisingly complex-especially within a large enterprise network-and evolve over time. Acquiring, maintaining, and understanding dependency knowledge is critical for many network management and cyber defense activities, such as cyber mission mapping. While automation can improve situation awareness for network operators and cyber practitioners, poor detection performance reduces their confidence and can complicate their roles. In this paper, we study the effects of network activity levels on the detection performance of passive network-based service dependency discovery methods. The performance of all methods except for one were inconsistent with respect to network activity levels. Our proposed cross-correlation method was particularly robust to the influence of network activity. The proposed experimental treatment will further advance a more scientific evaluation of methods and provide a foundation to determine their operational boundaries.},

abstract={We present and evaluate MCONF, a protocol that provides a means to successfully perform a mass configuration change in a MANET, with various modes of operation to account for different operating situations. The root node may unconditionally initiate a change or decide conditionally based on feedback from other nodes. MCONF is designed so that feedback and confirmation messages are sent back to the root node (and therefore to the network control center) in an efficient manner. MCONF does not rely on specific routing or medium access protocols, and therefore can work with a wide range of network and link layer technologies. Protocol performance is tested and validated using emulation for static and mobile topologies, several message sizes, and a range of link loss rates. Based on experimental results MCONF is found to successfully execute a mass configuration change with confirmation for 10-node MANETs with link loss rates approaching 20% and random node mobility.},

abstract={In this paper, we study how the recommendation of a product spreads across a social network assuming all members of the network recommend the product to their neighbors in a probabilistic manner. To do so, we consider a social network which is typically characterized by a scale-free network obeying power-law degree distribution. We take a layer-by-layer approach where nodes are labeled by how far they are from the origin node. Starting with the layer-1 nodes, we first compute the probability when the recommendation propagates outward from origin node considering the out-degree distribution. Then, we compute the probabilities when recommendations are made from nodes that are farther from the origin to nodes that are closer to the origin. Also, using the concept of clustering coefficient, we consider the recommendation probabilities within the same layer. Combining different possibilities, we are able to find the total effect. In order to demonstrate how recommendation spreads, we use Facebook data from SNAP and show how many nodes receive the recommendation in each layer and what the effect of the location of a node is with respect to the origin node.},

In this paper, we propose 3NCD (Network topology - Node attribute - NMF - Community Detection) algorithm that incorporates information from both network topology and node attributes in a unified non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) framework. The proposed algorithm not only achieves considerably higher accuracy but also runs markedly faster than the state-of-the-art methods. The superiority of our method is demonstrated in our experiments on three collections of real social networks with known ground-truth communities. Our experiments also suggest that the proposed method is robust against missing (incomplete) links and nodes' information.},

When a network operates in a contested environment, the operator may wish to alter the network topology to enhance robustness. This may come at the expense of operational costs. We consider a dynamic programming framework where the goal is to minimize time average costs, where costs are the sum of network property cost (e.g. eccentricity), edit costs and maintenance costs. We consider practical low-complexity control algorithms which focus on instantaneous network states. We introduce a horizon-aware modified myopic policy which attempts to reduce average cost by benefiting future costs. We also provide decision rules for different algorithms and characterize expected costs for random hostility models. Our numerical results demonstrate that our modified myopic scheduler outperform other schedulers in terms of average sum cost for various settings.},

If the SOTM terminal with multiple antennas acts as transmitter (Tx), beamforming, AS, and space-time coding could be applied to achieve Tx diversity. All strategies are able to enhance the coverage of the SOTM system depending upon the distance between the antennas.

This analysis is applicable to a general NGSO satellite system operating in the Ka-band. This analysis takes into consideration the pertinent International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Radio Regulations (RR) emission constraints that allow NGSO systems to coexist with GSO systems. It is shown that the spectral efficiency available from small-aperture satellite links depends on the location of the earth terminal: higher latitudes and smaller differences between the longitudes of the earth terminal and the satellite give higher spectral efficiency levels.},

abstract={Earth stations on moving platforms (ESOMPs) are a new generation of satellite terminals designed to provide on-the-move broadband communication services to land vehicles, aircraft, and ships. ESOMPs use very small antennas and require tracking systems to maintain accurate pointing to the target satellite. Because they operate while moving, there may be instances when antenna mispointing may produce interference to other satellites or other radio systems. To account for pointing errors and other time-varying characteristics of a network of ESOMPs, it is necessary to use statistical approaches for interference analysis. This paper provides an overview of ESOMPs, their technical and operational characteristics, statistical approaches for interference analysis, and the standards and regulatory challenges that must be addressed for their successful operation.},

Cloudlet-based cyber-foraging relies on discoverable, generic, forward-deployed servers located in single-hop proximity of mobile devices. In particular, we define tactical cloudlets as the infrastructure to support computation offload and data staging at the tactical edge. However, the characteristics of tactical environments, such as dynamic context, limited computing resources, disconnected-intermittent-limited (DIL) network connectivity, and high levels of stress pose a challenge for the continued operations of mobile systems that leverage cloudlets in tactical environments. This paper presents an architecture and experimental results that demonstrate that cyber-foraging using tactical cloudlets increases the survivability of mobile systems, defined as the capability of a system to be able to continue functioning in spite of adversity.},

abstract={Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) is the foundational technology for the Army's network modernization. Thus, spectrum management of MANETs is critical to efficient and effective MANET acquisition and deployment. The technical basis for the tactical spectrum management process is interference analysis. The results of interference analysis are highly dependent on the choice of interference protection criteria (IPC). In this paper, we present an approach to derive co-channel and adjacent channel IPC that result in efficient spectrum assignments. We derive general criteria for signal-to-interference ratio and then use stochastic geometry to determine the statistical distribution for the interference threshold. Also, we show that the use of Frequency-Dependent Rejection algorithm using appropriate filter characteristics can provide appropriate correction factors for adjacent channel IPC.},

Two separate trials were conducted, one in early summer, another in the autumn of 2014 for capturing diverse seasonal performance characteristics.

abstract={A recent study has introduced a new spread spectrum waveform based on filter bank multicarrier techniques. The proposed waveform that is called FB-MC-SS offers the advantages of simple implementation and robust performance when it is subject to narrow/partial band interference. This paper describes modifications to the FB-MC-SS system to enable its successful application to the HF skywave channels. We find FB-MC-SS well suited for the HF communications as it shows excellent performance in channels with frequency selective fading and interference. This paper describes new algorithms for packet detection, timing recovery and equalization that are suitable for the HF channel. Also, an algorithm for optimizing the peak to average power ratio (PAPR) of the FB-MC-SS waveform is presented. Application of this algorithm results in a waveform with a very low PAPR of about 4 dB. Simulation results using a wide band HF channel model demonstrate the robustness of this system over a wide range of delay and Doppler spreads.},

SECANT supports concurrent multiple access (MA) transmissions to common receivers and parallel peer-to-peer (P2P) transmissions in the network. SECANT combines multiuser multiple-input multiple output (MU-MIMO), multiuser detection (MUD), and interference alignment (IA) methods at the PHY layer such that spectrum efficiency can be improved in both interference and signal spaces. An adaptive medium access control (MAC) mechanism is developed to enable spectrum efficiency gains at the PHY layer by managing concurrent transmissions and interference levels. Numerical results indicate significant spectrum efficiency gains (>14 times for fully loaded, and >56 times for 25% loading) that can be achieved over conventional single antenna systems with static MAC protocols.},

abstract={Millimeter wave (mmWave) technology has several technical hurdles to overcome before becoming an integral next-generation wireless technology. One such hurdle is the alignment of the steerable mmWave antenna array. This paper quantifies both the ergodic capacity of a mmWave ad hoc network with perfect alignment and the loss in ergodic capacity when error is introduced. First, we leverage stochastic geometry to evaluate the ergodic capacity (bits/sec/Hz/area) in the network. Next, we compare two antenna models that are commonly used: sectored and Gaussian. Lastly, we derive expressions that quantify the loss in ergodic capacity per user when alignment error occurs at the receiver and transmitter. Our results show that even relatively small errors in alignment can lead to significant ergodic capacity reduction.},

abstract={The growth in demand for wireless broadband is increasing the instrumental value of characterizing interference in spectral bands of interest. In particular, detection and classification of interference is an important function for mobile ad hoc network (MANET) nodes to optimize performance. In this paper, we propose interference detection and classification techniques for a network that consists of N distributed nodes and a classification center connected to each node by a robust link. Due to the limited capacity of the network connecting these nodes, each node compresses the observed signal into a binary vector that spans time and frequency and provides the bits to a classification center. In turn, the classification center stitches the compressed signals from all nodes into a single structure with characteristics that are exploited to detect and classify. The Kolmorgorov-Smirnov test is proposed for node compression. Furthermore, bounds on theoretical classification performance from finite blocklength coding theory are defined. Finally, we propose a minimum distance method to perform classification.},

abstract={We investigate methods of co-existence between radar and communications systems. Since historically each system views the other as a source of interference, the systems are traditionally isolated spectrally or spatially in order to prevent performance degradation. By considering a cooperative radar and communications signaling scheme, we derive achievable bounds on performance for a receiver that observes communications and radar return in the same frequency allocation. These inner bounds on performance will be derived in scenarios where the radar system has to perform target parameter estimation for multiple targets. Additionally, a novel inner bound that maximizes the Fisher information for radar parameter estimation is also derived. Bounds on performance of the joint system are measured in terms of data information rate for communications and radar estimation information rate parameterization for the radar.},

The performance of the existing per-survivor processing (PSP) algorithm which uses decision-feedback sequence estimation (DFSE) to do the detection of the two sources is firstly analyzed. It is found that the BER of the PSP algorithm with DFSE is affected by the sampling instance. A sampling instance which leads to lower bit error ratio (BER) as compared with the conventional sampling instance is then proposed. Simulation results show that by using the proposed sampling instance, the BER obtained by the PSP algorithm with DFSE is improved by about 2dB in terms of SNR.},

abstract={This paper proposes a technique for intercepting the symmetric signals and uses the example of the widely used Triangular FM waveform as a case study, due to its importance. The interception process involves performing convolution of the received signal with itself. Due to the symmetric nature of the Triangular FM waveform, the output of this self-convolution procedure is the same as the autocorrelation function of the Triangular FM waveform with a slightly higher sidelobe pedestal due to added noise. The higher sidelobe pedestal results in incurring a small SNR loss which is the price paid for blind interception of the triangular FM waveform. Simulations in this paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique in the presence of noise. In addition, the proposed technique is found to be immune to Doppler shift and fast fading.},

abstract={Analyzing massive network and security logs that record network events is crucial for diagnosing network anomalies in large-scale network environments. Extracting log message formats is an important and necessary step to achieve the goal. However, it is time-consuming and costly to automatically and efficiently extract log message formats from massive network and security logs of many different types, which are generated by the increasing number of network and security devices and services used in large-scale networks. In this paper, we propose log template extraction (LTE), an approach that is semantics aware of network and security logs to address the problem. LTE first cleans log messages and then clusters the cleaned log messages based on the DBSCAN algorithm. At last it infers message templates by LDA Gibbs sampling algorithm. We evaluate our work on massive amount of network log messages collected from a large production network. Experimental results show that LTE approach infers and gets multiple log message formats at the same time with more than 90% accuracy and 100% recall.},

pages={1548-1553}, 
abstract={Whilst tactical networks must provide basic functionality over highly restricted networks including basic VHF links and should tolerate outright disruption and partitioning, it is highly desirable to provide access to richer services available within the tactical network, from higher-level units, or through cyber foraging. The resulting requirement to also invoke services asynchronously or to delegate authority while also incorporating constraints and obligations limits the effectiveness of conventional access control mechanisms. Centralised security policy decisions are also undesirable, and as policies will evolve over the course of a mission, mere replication is also insufficient. In this paper we describe a distributed security policy mechanism based on the tactical nodes' specializations, where policies can be partitioned based on security domains, network layers and kinetic tasks represented by Boyd's OODA-loop (Observe, Orient, Decide and Act loop). This permits security policy decisions incorporating services' protection goals and constraints based on inference mechanisms dealing with mission's current context.},

abstract={Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) facilitates the provisioning of virtual machines (VMs) in cloud computing platform for disjoint customers in a highly scalable, flexible, and cost-efficient fashion. However, introducing new VMs to a physical server where vulnerable VM already exists could lead to potential security risks to the new ones. Furthermore, even the physical server itself could be compromised by attackers through one of these vulnerable VMs. Therefore, VM placement could bring great impact over the security level of the whole cloud. In this paper, we first quantify the security risks of cloud environments based on virtual machine vulnerabilities and placement schemes. Based on our security evaluation, we present a novel VM placement algorithm that can minimize the cloud's overall security risks by considering the connections among VMs. According to the experimental results, our approach can greatly improve the survivability of most VMs and the entire cloud. The computing costs and deployment costs of our techniques are also practical.},

abstract={We are proposing a layered and scalable WAVE (Wireless Access for Vehicular Environments) security structure for VANET (Vehicular Ad hoc Network) network. The scalability and variable message delivery are provided by using both asymmetric and symmetric encryption algorithm. The whole region is divided into different security domains and the security related load of each domain is distributed evenly. At the top Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) generates keys and store information of Master and Edge RSU (MRSU/ERSU), which in turn store the keys and information of RSU. MRSU/ERSU also provide the pseudonym seeds and store information of vehicles. RSU is used only as access point for contacting transportation authority or access internet. High priority emergency message delivery is expedited by using symmetric key cryptography. Besides, the simulation comparison shows that our scheme also provide significantly improved network throughput without compromising security goals.},

abstract={Smart grid is a modern electrical grid that utilizes Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and information networks. Growing attraction in Electric Vehicles (EV) shall likely provide a fundamental shift not only in transportation sector but also in the existing electrical grid infrastructure. In Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) network, participating EVs can be used to store energy and supply this energy back to the power grid when required. To realize proper deployment of V2G network, charging infrastructure having various entities such as charging facility, clearinghouse, and energy provider has to be constructed. So use of Public key infrastructure (PKI) is indispensable for provisioning security solutions in V2G networks. The ISO/IEC 15118 standard is ascribed that incorporates X.509 PKI solution for V2G network. However, as traditional X.509 based PKI for V2G network has several shortcomings, we have proposed a multi-domain PKI model for V2G network that is built on elliptic curve cryptography and a self-certified public key technique having implicit certificate. We illustrate that the proposed solutions outperform the existing ones.},

abstract={Contexts like Defense and Aerospace are steadily focused on high assurance solutions designed to protect their data. One of the most relevant and unresolved issue is the Multilevel Security problem. Information and Communications Technology systems have to exchange data, to be regularly patched and updated hence, they require a link to the Internet. Through this connection and through a compromised host, an attacker could illicitly disclose sensitive information. In this paper is presented a novel Multiple Independent Levels of Security/Safety solution that enforces the security policies in a cross-domain environment. The innovative approach is explained in detail and the robustness of the solution is evaluated in a theoretical way, supported by tools specifically designed to analyze security protocols and by preliminary vulnerability and penetration tests.},

abstract={The concept of Trusted Computing offers a hardware platform based on which the integrity of IT systems is verified using a structured file-based signature hierarchy of all executable system components - from BIOS boot up to the execution of any user application. Current implementations detect integrity breaches at firmware and at file level so that suitable counter measures on a Trusted Computing system may be taken in almost real-time. This information - so far - either remains stored locally or in best case is forwarded at application layer leaving enough time for a smart malware to infect a peering system or to compromise application level communication. This paper introduces a new pro-active concept of integrity monitoring and reporting using the Trusted Platform Module to supervise the integrity of a system focusing on incident reporting to peering systems at link layer. For this concept we suggest the enhancement of the Trusted Platform Module by a new Attack Recognition Module to monitor a system in real time and to reliably notify peering systems about any integrity breach detected.},

abstract={Cross-domain information exchange is necessary to obtain information superiority in the military domain, and should be based on assigning appropriate security labels to the information objects. Most of the data found in a defense network is unlabeled, and usually new unlabeled information is produced every day. Humans find that doing the security labeling of such information is labor-intensive and time consuming. At the same time there is an information explosion observed where more and more unlabeled information is generated year by year. This calls for tools that can do advanced content inspection, and automatically determine the security label of an information object correspondingly. This paper presents a machine learning approach to this problem. To the best of our knowledge, machine learning has hardly been analyzed for this problem, and the analysis on topical classification presented here provides new knowledge and a basis for further work within this area. Presented results are promising and demonstrates that machine learning can become a useful tool to assist humans in determining the appropriate security label of an information object.},

abstract={Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) is a public safety system that uses broadcast from cell towers to send geographically-targeted alerts and warnings to cell phones. It is one of the dissemination channels for the Integrated Public Alert and Warnings System (IPAWS). WEA typically broadcasts an alert in the cells with at least some portion affected by the emergency event. When the affected area includes only portions of one or more cells, there could be a high proportion of False Positives (people who should not have been notified get the message on their cell phones) and/or False Negatives (people who should have been notified but are not notified). We propose a scheme that uses the mobile devices' knowledge of their own location and the target area described in the cell broadcast message to filter the messages in the cell phone and notify the user only when the mobile device's estimated location is within the target area. We evaluate the new scheme in terms of false negatives and positives, radio resource requirements, and notification latency, and compare it with various other geotargeting schemes. We also discuss mechanisms to communicate the target area information efficiently in the limited bandwidth available in cellular broadcast channel. Finally, we discuss ways for allowing a broader set of contexts to determine whether a user should be notified of a given emergency.},

A number of mechanisms have been used to ensure that the location information provided by the mobile device is accurate. In this paper, we introduce the notion of gathering evidences independently where each entity reports contacts with other entities in specific locations at specific times. Some of the reports may be not true and in order to scrutinize these, we introduce the global consistency check. This is mainly based on the model similar to the block chain model in Bitcoin. With a global consistency check we can ensure if a particular entity is being dishonest about the location information. We have used the EigenTrust and PeerTrust check methodologies to calculate global and personalised trust matrix while confirming attestation. The paper also shows the importance of global attestation scheme over local attestation.},

abstract={The Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) system uses cellular broadcasts to send emergency messages to cell phones in the area affected by an emergency (target area or TA). The granularity of cell broadcast areas limits geotargeting accuracy and results in False Positives (cell phones outside the TA getting the emergency message) and/or False Negatives (cell phones in the TA not getting the message). We have proposed a scheme where the mobile device uses its knowledge of its own geolocation to filter received emergency messages and alerts the user only if the mobile is inside the TA. This scheme can leverage the geolocation capabilities available in cellular systems for navigation and E911 applications. In this paper, we evaluate and compare many geolocation techniques in terms of their effectiveness for WEA filtering application. Based on the comparisons, we recommend a specific set of techniques working together as the best solution.

Two generations (so called 2G and 3G ALE) have been standardized since the 90s, and are today being revisited due to the emergence of wideband HF waveforms. In this paper, we model ALE protocols using an abstraction model based on Markov chains. Our model captures faster and more easily than simulations the main characteristics of the ALE processes and the interactions between their numerous parameters. In that sense, this model constitutes a useful tool to help design and benchmark future ALE strategies. In order to validate the model, classical ALE simulations have also been carried out, that show the high similarity obtained with the model. We also show how to exploit the model to give insights on the limitations of current 2G ALE, for instance on the handshake method and on the impact of frequency selection strategy on the ALE duration.},

This massive dataset demonstrates that the traditional HF NVIS channel models are ill-suited to describe the observed HF NVIS propagation phenomena. In particular, it is observed that the HF NVIS channel is often non-stationary over a few minutes; with taps rapidly shifting in delay, exhibiting abrupt changes in phase characteristics, and periodic variations in magnitude-all having significant implications on modem design, e.g. block length, preamble length and repetition rate, interleaving size, and modulation type. To this end, this study summarizes the empirical findings of the delay and Doppler characteristics, as well as the non-traditional fading modes, of wideband HF NVIS channels.},

Multiple sources of ground conductivity and permittivity information and various methods for estimating terrain effects are employed, with the goal of approximating the measured path-loss values as accurately as possible. Estimates are obtained using the Rotheram-Millington spherical-Earth model as well as models that take the path's terrain profile into account, including a simple clearance angle model and more elaborate models estimating knife-edge diffraction loss using the methods of Bullington, Epstein-Peterson, and Deygout. Ground conductivity and permittivity values are obtained from standard ITU conductivity maps or directly measured at the transmit and receive locations. The Google Maps API is used to provide the terrain profile across each link. The resulting improvements in ground-wave path-loss estimation will contribute to more effective communications planning in HF radio networks, and to defining realistic scenarios for simulation studies of MANET protocols and cognitive radio techniques for use at HF.},

Transmitting and receiving on two co-located orthogonal linear polarized antennas 1) makes the link more robust to fading, 2) removes possibility of polarization loss, 3) can nearly double the data throughput by effectively establishing two links, and 4) is a form of multiple input multiple output communications (MIMO). This paper introduces a simple and flexible model for a dual polarized (DP) HF MIMO channel, illustrates how to develop specific instantiations of the model based on channel measurements, including ionosondes, and presents some performance comparisons between single input single output HF communications and DP HF MIMO. A contribution of this paper is the introduction of this flexible DP HF MIMO channel model that will allow researchers to develop instantiations of HF DP channel models from readily available ionosonde data and determine the performance benefits of HF DP MIMO under a variety of ionospheric propagation conditions and antenna orientations.},

abstract={Use of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) (or, drones) is expected to grow dramatically in the coming decades. For civil UAS that must share airspace with piloted aircraft, safety is paramount. Hence, requirements for a highly-reliable control and non-payload communication (CNPC) link are under development. Since designing a reliable link requires accurate knowledge of the channel characteristics, validated models for the air-ground (AG) channel are essential. In this paper we report results of SIMO AG measurements made for a NASA project in a near-urban environment (Cleveland, OH), for the two bands recently allocated for civil UAS CNPC: L-band (~970 MHz) and C-band (~5.06 GHz). Example channel characteristics are provided for a single flight track. For this flight track, path loss exponents were found to be 1.6 in L-band and 1.9 in C-band. Small scale fading Ricean K factors were 13 dB in L-band and 27 dB in C-band. The C-band root mean square delay spread was approximately 10 ns for most of the time, but reached 180 ns when reflections from buildings in the urban area were present. Spatial and inter-band correlation statistics are also reported. Tapped delay line models for near-urban AG channels will be presented in the near future.},

pages={1679-1684}, 
abstract={This paper proposes and analyzes an efficient cooperative relaying selection scheme (eCoRSS) based on time division multiple access (TDMA) for military tactical multi-hop wireless networks (MTMWNs). The scheme uses a set of idle neighbors to reach a relay node, after the neighbors meet the conditions for serving as assistant nodes. The assistant nodes with a high channel quality are allowed to transmit packets preassigned to a relay node when the relay node is busy or attacked in battle fields. Hence, the relay node can easily process multiple packets during only one frame and throughput can be improved without increasing the delay time. Furthermore, due to considering the proposed method in a mobile network, a dynamic SNR threshold is defined to compare with neighbor nodes' link SNRs and decide which node qualifies for an assistant node. The simulation results demonstrate that eCoRSS significantly outperforms conventional TDMA in performance in terms of throughput and end-to-end delay.},

abstract={This paper presents the optimal transmission scheme for a subscriber communicating to/through an airborne relay. This scheme provides situational awareness to each communication subscriber by considering channel variations (predicted offline and estimated in real time from relay signals), data traffic and energy consumption (subject to energy constraints for battery-operated units). The optimal decision on when and at what rate to transmit is made individually by each subscriber to maximize the expected throughput. Both cases of uplink communications (from subscriber to the relay) and relay communications (from a subscriber to the relay and back to another subscriber) are considered. For a given airborne relay orbit/trajectory, a high fidelity channel model is built (using real terrain information) to predict future channel conditions. These predicted channels are combined with instantaneous channel estimation from received signals to calculate signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and link rate (using analytical waveform models). By using different relay orbits, the optimal transmission decision is compared with SNR threshold-based and channel-independent random transmission schemes, and significant performance gains are demonstrated in terms of sustained data rates for communication subscribers.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate how to adapt a composite decode-forward (DF) two-way relaying scheme to fading links. We develop a maximum entropy (ME) quantization algorithm to feed back the link magnitudes such that the transmitters are able to perform link adaptation. The ME algorithm outperforms that of Lloyd-Max in mid and high range SNR, and performs comparably at low SNR. With just one bit of ME quantization feedback, rate performance of the composite DF scheme is better than that of long-term channel state information (CSI). With three quantization bits, performance is close to that of perfect CSI. We further evaluate the sensitivity of the ME quantizer to errors in the estimated channel distribution. The developed ME quantization algorithm can also be applied in any compression scenario with known data distribution, including real-time applications because of the simplicity of the quantizer.},

abstract={Discovering and maintaining efficient routes for data dissemination in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) has proven to be a very challenging problem. Clustering is one of the control protocols used to provide efficient and stable routes for data dissemination. However, the rapid changes in network topology in VANETs creates frequent cluster reformation, which can seriously affect route stability. We propose a novel Evolutionary Game Theoretic (EGT) framework to automate the clustering of nodes and nominations of cluster heads, to achieve cluster stability in VANETs. The equilibrium point is proven analytically and the stability is also tested using Lyapunov function. The performance of proposed evolutionary game is empirically investigated with different cost functions using static and mobile scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed EGT approach for different populations and speeds, thus reducing the overhead of frequent cluster reformation in VANETs.},

abstract={In a tactical communication network (TCN), it is important during military operations to provide timely and accurate information transmission. Accordingly, mobility management plays a key role in supporting the mobility and connectivity of mobile nodes (MNs). In battlefield environments, the intermediate nodes(INs), such as a backbone node or an access node, can due to enemy attack be partially or completely damaged. In order to solve these issues, different distributed mobility management (DMM) schemes have been introduced. However, the existing DMM schemes do not offer any efficient solution to maintain the ongoing communication sessions of MNs associated with a destroyed IN. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a robust mobility management scheme for TCNs. The proposed scheme not only enables the disconnected MNs to attach to a new IN, but by creating IP tunnels, also maintains their ongoing communication sessions. In order to evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme, we develop a physical test-bed environment. With the help of mathematical and experimental results, we show that the proposed scheme outperforms the legacy schemes in terms of service availability, network throughput, and first packet arrival time.},

abstract={Spectrum is limited, but the demand for it is growing steadily with new users, applications, and services in both commercial and tactical communications. The current paradigm of static spectrum allocation cannot satisfy this demand, resulting in a congested, contested environment with poor spectrum efficiency. Tactical radios need to share spectrum with other in- and out-of-network tactical and commercial radios, subject to potential jamming and other security attacks. Cognitive radio provides tactical communications with new means of spectrum sharing, cohabitation configurability, and adaptation to improve communication rates, connectivity, robustness, and situational awareness, all translated to network- centric mission success. A systematic solution to SDR programming and test and evaluation (T&E) is needed to address spectrum challenges with the network-centric mission success set as the primary goal. Once equipped with cognitive radio capabilities, tactical radios can quickly and reliably discover the white-space and effectively use spectrum opportunities across time, space, and frequency. This article presents the design and implementation of a visual and modular radio software programming tool that supports easy, fast, and radio-agnostic development of cognitive radio and network protocols and security mechanisms. This tool is fully integrated with a unified T&E framework that applies the same SDR solution to high fidelity simulation and emulation tests under a common, controllable, and repeatable scenario. This unified approach makes prototyping of cognitive radio capabilities with tactical radios faster, easier, and cost-effective.},

In addition to enabling high-rate twoway tactical communications, the STAR capability could give a major technical advantage to armed forces by allowing their radio transceivers to conduct electronic warfare at the same time that they are also receiving or transmitting other signals at the same frequency bands. After comprehensively introducing FD transceiver architectures and SIC requirements in military communications, this article outlines and analyzes all the most promising defensive and offensive applications of the STAR capability. It is not out of the question that this disruptive technology could even bring about a paradigm shift in operations at the cyber-electromagnetic battleground.

abstract={Laser technology has observed a great advancement over the last few decades. This technology is used for a wide range of applications including medical sciences, military, industrial manufacturing, electronics, holography, spectroscopy, astronomy and much more. Military operations often demand a secure and timely transmission of a massive amount of information from one place to another. Until now, the military has relied on the radio spectrum for effective communication, which is vulnerable to security threats and susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI). Also, this spectrum is hard-pressed to meet the current bandwidth requirement for high-resolution images, on-air video conferencing and real-time data transfer. Therefore, the focus has shifted to visible and infrared spectrum using laser technology which is capable of providing secure data transfer because of its immunity to EMI. The probability of intercepting a laser signal is very low due to its narrow beam divergence and coherent optical beam, making the laser a suitable candidate for secure military tactical operations. Besides the communication aspect, the highly directive nature of a laser beam is also used as a directed energy laser weapon. These highly powerful and light weighted directed energy laser weapons are very cost-effective countermeasures for airborne threats. Furthermore, laser sensors are deployed in the battlefield or in space for tracking the path of a wide range of military vehicles like missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles, fighter aircraft, warships, submarines, and so on. Advancements in space operations and laser technology have offered synergistic possibilities of using lasers from space-based platforms during military operations. In this paper, we are providing our readers with a comprehensive study of laser applications, used by the military, to carry out tactical operations on the ground or space-based platforms. Also, an intensive investigation on the development of laser t- chnology for sensors, range-finders and target designators that are used for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance is presented in the paper. The advancement of laser communication for military purposes and its current state of the art is reviewed as well as some recent scientific developments in the area of high-energy directed laser weapons are discussed, which have revolutionized military battlefields. Therefore, this manuscript highlights recent trends and engineering breakthroughs for the use of lasers in tactical operations.},

pages={19662-19667},
abstract={The traditional MAC protocol in ad hoc networks includes carrier sensing to judge the busy/idle state of a channel. However, in airborne tactical networks, the results of carrier sensing are usually inaccurate due to the wide distribution of nodes, large communication distance, and high-dynamic network topology, and the carrier sensing causes a large transmission delay and low channel utilization ratio. In this paper, we propose a novel channel busy recognition mechanism combined with auto regressive (AR) forecasting, namely, L-steps-revise AR (LS-AR). LS-AR predicts the number of bursts in the current time frame based on the number of bursts received in previous time frames, and the predicted number of bursts determines the channel busy/idle state. The difference between the predicted value and the true value serves as the means for correcting the next prediction. This mechanism avoids the delay caused by carrier sensing, improves the channel utilization ratio and provides a more accurate judgment to enable different priority packets to access a channel. The simulation results show that the algorithm can accurately predict the channel load and meet the requirements of the MAC protocol in airborne tactical networks.},

abstract={Wireless power transfer may enable remotely powered operation of low-energy devices in challenging environments such as tactical networks. Millimeter wave (mmWave) is a possible candidate for wireless power transfer, thanks to the use of directional antenna arrays. This letter presents a feasibility study of using mmWave for wireless power transfer in a large-scale network consisting of power beacons and energy harvesters. Using stochastic geometry, system performance is characterized while treating the network nodes as potential blockages to mmWave signals. A link-level metric (energy coverage probability) and a network-level metric (overall success probability) are considered. The former captures whether a typical energy transfer link provides the requisite energy, while the latter also takes the network load into account. Numerical simulations suggest that network densification helps improve the performance, despite an increase in the blockage density.

abstract={In this paper, we consider data capture of a cognitive radio-based red network in tactical wireless networks. In the blue (friendly) network, an eavesdropping sensor node is deployed to capture data of the red (adversary) network, where the red network adopts cognitive radio for opportunistic data transmission. Since most wireless networks suffer energy constraints, we investigate the data capture (eavesdropping) performance of the blue network in two scenarios of energy management: no energy harvesting and energy harvesting. In both of the energy scenarios, we formulate the problem of maximizing data-capturing performance of blue network in the framework of a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) by considering feedback observations of actions. Furthermore, a recursive method is adopted to solve the problem by which the optimal action policy for the eavesdropping sensor nodes of blue network is obtained. Finally, we compare the performances of the proposed scheme with those of different reference methods under the two mentioned energy scenarios. Numerical results show that the proposed POMDP-based scheme can improve the data-capturing performance of the eavesdropping sensor node.},

title={Group-centric networking: addressing information sharing requirements at the tactical edge},
year={2016},
volume={54},
number={10},
pages={145-151},
abstract={In recent years, there has been a large push in the U.S. Department of Defense to move to an all-IP infrastructure, particularly on the tactical edge. IP and associated protocols were designed primarily for wired networks tied to fixed infrastructure. Although extensions to support MANET have received decades of research, in practice, there are few successful implementations. Challenges include handling mobility, managing lossy links, and scaling to large numbers of users. Unfortunately, these are the exact conditions military tactical edge networks must operate within: high mobility, high loss, and large numbers of users. To address the needs and particular challenges of military tactical edge information sharing requirements, we consider a new class of networking approaches called group-centric networks that focuses on dynamic and resilient formation of interest groups. The structure of tactical networks limits the majority of collaboration and network traffic to within a group of users that share a set of common interests (i.e., platoons, 4-ships, etc.). These groups are formed either prior to the mission or on the fly with only a minor amount of traffic flowing outside of these groups. Group-centric networking approaches can help connect users in military tactical edge networks. In addition, we also discuss an instantiation of a group-centric network protocol called Group Centric Networking (GCN), compare GCN against a traditional MANET routing approach on a 90-node Android mobile phone testbed, and discuss implications for tactical edge users.},

year={2016},

pages={2642-2649},
abstract={The growth in wireless communication services together with increasing demand has resulted in the scarcity of spectrum resources. Many researchers have attempted to address the scarcity problem by focusing on spectrum sharing to allow fixed satellite services (FSS) to coexist with other fixed services or other satellite communication systems. However, most secondary users are commercial systems, whose characteristics differ from military systems such as tactical data links (TDLs). A TDL requires anti-jamming capability and multiple operations support; thus, most TDLs use multiple frequency hopping (FH) patterns, known as multinet. To the best of our knowledge, no research has focused on the coexistence of FSS and TDL to date. In this paper, we verify whether spectrum sharing will facilitate the coexistence of FSS and FH-TDL. First, we propose FH-TDL with a spectrum use rule and a new FH method to reduce the pulse collision probability. We then prove that interference from FH-TDL to FSS is permissible. Instead of analyzing interference from FSS to FH-TDL, we simply consider the worst case, i.e., that a signal experiencing interference by FSS is always subject to collisions. We analyze the pulse collision probability under the worst case by constructing the mathematical models rather than using simulation. The numerical results show that the use of appropriate values for the weight parameter enables the proposed FH method to improve the pulse collision probability of FH-TDL.},

pages={81-89},
abstract={Relative navigation is a key feature in the joint tactical information distribution system (JTIDS). A parametric message passing algorithm based on factor graph is proposed to perform relative navigation in JTIDS. First of all, the joint posterior distribution of all the terminals' positions is represented by factor graph. Because of the nonlinearity between the positions and time-of-arrival (TOA) measurement, messages cannot be obtained in closed forms by directly using the sum-product algorithm on factor graph. To this end, the Euclidean norm is approximated by Taylor expansion. Then, all the messages on the factor graph can be derived in Gaussian forms, which enables the terminals to transmit means and covariances. Finally, the impact of major error sources on the navigation performance are evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations, e.g., range measurement noise, priors of position uncertainty and velocity noise. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the extended Kalman filter and cooperative extended Kalman filter in both static and mobile scenarios of the JTIDS.},

abstract={We consider video transmission over a mobile cognitive radio (CR) system operating in a hostile environment where an intelligent adversary tries to disrupt communications. We investigate the optimal strategy for spoofing, desynchronizing, and jamming a cluster-based CR network with a Gaussian noise signal over a slow Rayleigh fading channel. The adversary can limit access for secondary users (SUs) by either transmitting a spoofing signal in the sensing interval, or a desynchronizing signal in the code acquisition interval. By jamming the network during the transmission interval, the adversary can reduce the rate of successful transmission. We show how the adversary can optimally allocate its energy across subcarriers during sensing, code acquisition, and transmission intervals. We determine a worst-case optimal energy allocation for spoofing, desynchronizing, and jamming, which gives an upper bound to the received video distortion of SUs. We also propose cross-layer resource allocation algorithms and evaluate their performance under disruptive attacks.},

abstract={Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is an efficient multi-carrier modulation technique for wireless communication. However, one of the main drawbacks encountered in implementing it is its resultant high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Many techniques have been proposed in the literature to substantially decrease the peaks in the OFDM signal. The problem with these, however, is that their effects on other parameters are not always positive. These effects include a decrease in the bit error rate (BER), an increase in complexity, or a reduction in the bit rate. The objective of this paper is to describe the PAPR problem in a bid to reduce the peaks in the OFDM signal. The paper proposes a classification, performance evaluation and optimization of PAPR reduction techniques for commercial, public safety, and tactical applications. In the taxonomy proposed herein, we also include a new category, namely, hybrid techniques. Furthermore, we compare the principal characteristics through a complementary cumulative distribution function and BER evaluation, and conclude on the importance of hybrid techniques, when the goal is to both improve the BER and reduce the PAPR.},

abstract={Controlled natural language (CNL) has great potential to support human-machine interaction (HMI) because it provides an information representation that is both human readable and machine processable. We investigated the effectiveness of a CNL-based conversational interface for HMI in a behavioral experiment called simple human experiment regarding locally observed collective knowledge (SHERLOCK). In SHERLOCK, individuals acted in groups to discover and report information to the machine using natural language (NL), which the machine then processed into CNL. The machine fused responses from different users to form a common operating picture, a dashboard showing the level of agreement for distinct information. To obtain information to add to this dashboard, users explored the real world in a simulated crowdsourced sensing scenario. This scenario represented a simplified controlled analog for tactical intelligence (i.e., direct intelligence of the environment), which is key for rapidly planning military, law enforcement, and emergency operations. Overall, despite close to zero training, 74% of the users inputted NL that was machine interpretable and addressed the assigned tasks. An experimental manipulation aimed to increase user-machine interaction, however, did not improve performance as hypothesized. Nevertheless, results indicate that the conversational interface may be effective in assisting humans with collection and fusion of information in a crowdsourcing context.},

abstract={In-vehicle information display is critical for driving safety and has been the focus of transportation and display technology research. Cellphone use, while driving is popular, leads to distraction and impairs driving performance. A new head-mounted display (HMD), Google Glass, has been developed in hope of reducing the visual distractions caused by a head-down display (HDD), such as a smartphone. Alternatively, HMD could induce greater distraction by giving drivers the false impression that they are simultaneously paying attention to both the HMD and the road. We compared driving performance in a simulated tactical lane-changing task while drivers read from either an HMD (e.g., Google Glass) or an HDD (e.g., smartphone). Although both HMD and HDD use impaired driving performance, drivers produced smaller lane variation, had fewer lane excursions, and lower subjective workload when using an HMD than when using an HDD. Wearable display technologies like Google Glass might reduce the impairment caused by looking down at a smartphone.},

pages={192-205},
abstract={This two-part paper aims to study lane change behaviors at the tactical level from an on-road perspective, with a special focus on analyzing the interactions between an ego and surrounding vehicles during the procedure. Part I addresses vehicle trajectory collection, whereas Part II addresses lane change extraction and scene-based behavioral analysis. Different from the general technique of moving object detection and tracking, trajectory collection for tactical driving behavior study is required to have the properties of consistency, completeness, continuity, and accuracy. This paper proposes a system of on-road vehicle trajectory collection, where an instrumented vehicle is developed with multiple horizontal 2-D lidars that have 360° coverage. The software is developed by fitting the laser points of all lidars on a vehicle model using a coupled estimation of features and reliability along frames to achieve accurate state estimations of occluded data and robust data association in multiviewpoint sensing. The performance is investigated extensively, and a large trajectory set is developed through on-road driving at the Fourth Ring Road in Beijing for a total distance of 64 km, with more than 5700 environmental trajectories with a total length of over 19 h. The performance is demonstrated to be of high quality in terms of the required properties. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first system that is able to automatically collect all-around vehicle trajectories during on-road driving and to demonstrate good performance in providing a high-quality database for driving behavior studies from an on-road perspective that addresses vehicle interactions in real-world traffic at the trajectory level.},

abstract={Global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) is becoming a widely accepted technique for remote sensing. The interferometric technique (iGNSS-R) correlates the direct signal received from a satellite and the same signal reflected on the Earth's surface, whereas the conventional technique (cGNSS-R) correlates the reflected signal with a locally generated replica of the transmitted code. As GNSS signals are received below the noise level, this technique is extremely sensitive to radio frequency interference. The distance measurement equipment, and the TACtical air navigation systems are two radio navigation systems that transmit in the GPS L5, and Galileo E5 bands with powers up to 3.5 kW. This work studies in depth the impact of these systems on iGNSS-R, and cGNSS-R instruments. This study is then applied to a hypothetical reflectometer that will be placed in the international space station: The GEROS experiment. It is shown that the received power in space will be strong enough to degrade the system's performance by increasing the noise floor, but the sea altimetry precision will still be accurate enough for scientific studies.},

abstract={The recent advances in drone technology significantly improved the effectiveness of applications such as border surveillance, disaster management, seismic surveying, and precision agriculture. The use of drones as base stations to improve communication in the next generation wireless networks is another attractive application. However, the deployment of drone base stations (DBSs) is not an easy task and requires a carefully designed strategy. Fairness is one of the most important metrics of tactical communications or a disaster-affected network and must be considered for the efficient deployment of DBSs. In this study, a fairness-aware multiple DBS deployment algorithm is proposed. As the proposed algorithm uses particle swarm optimisation (PSO) that requires significant processing power, simpler algorithms with faster execution times are also proposed and the results are compared. The simulations are performed to evaluate the performance of the algorithms in two different network scenarios. The simulation results show that the proposed PSO-based method finds the three-dimensional locations of DBSs, achieving the best fairness performance with a minimum number of DBSs for deployment. However, it is shown that the proposed suboptimal algorithm performs very close to the PSO-based solution and requires significantly less processing time.},

abstract={To achieve model reuse in combat effectiveness simulation systems development, cognitive decision behaviors are usually implemented using a scripting language, which is separate from the programming language used to implement simulation models. Therefore, it is desirable to establish a much better grounding for cognitive behaviors modeling. In the context of domain specific modeling, metamodeling from scratch for designing such a scripting language poses some limitations, among which is the issue of integrating various models that are represented by various customized languages with different syntax and semantics, together with a large expenditure of designing, implementing, and maintaining these languages and their supporting resources. Instead, UML profile-based metamodeling is adopted, as a lightweight extension to capture the cognitive domain specific concepts, relationships, and constraints. Moreover, a unifying framework is proposed to guide the cognitive domain specific profiles design. Upon this framework, the development process is shown through constructing an anti-submarine tactical profile in combat effectiveness simulation systems domain and the feasibility of the domain specific language is illustrated with an armed escort scenario.},

abstract={In recent years, we have observed a resurgence of DDoS attacks. These attacks often exploit vulnerable servers (e.g., DNS and NTP) to produce large amounts of traffic with little effort. However, we have also observed the appearance of application-level DDoS attacks, which leverage corner cases in the logic of an application in order to severely reduce the availability of the provided service. In both cases, these attacks are used to extort a ransom, to hurt a target organization, or to gain some tactical advantage. As it has happened for many of the components in the underground economy, DDoS has been commoditized, and DDoS as a service (DaaS) providers allow paying customers to buy and direct attacks against specific targets. In this article, we present a measurement study of 17 different DaaS providers, in which we analyzed the different techniques used to launch DDoS attacks, as well as the infrastructure leveraged in order to carry out the attacks. Results show a growing market of short-lived providers, where DDoS attacks are available at low cost (tens of dollars) and capable of easily disrupting connections of over 1.4 Gb/s. In our study, particular attention was given to characterize application-level (HTTP) DDoS attacks, which are more difficult to study given the low volume of traffic they generate and the need to study the logic of the application providing the target service.},

abstract={Since a tactical electromagnetic railgun system is required to fire several times a minute, the thermal load on the rails leads to a higher temperature, which will even result in launch failures and reduce the life span of the launcher. In this paper, the rail temperature was measured during the launch experiment. Furthermore, based on a 3-D transient model with moving armature, mechanically, thermally coupled electromagnetic field analysis using finite-element method is presented. The Joule heating is one of the main heat sources in the rails. Contact resistance and friction force that cause heat between the armature and the rail are also included in the model. The simulation results show that the peak temperature in the rail occurs at the inner surface. Overall, along the direction of armature motion, the temperature of the rail near the breech end is higher than at the muzzle end, and the maximum temperature on the rail appears near the initial position of the armature. The contact resistance contributes much more than friction to the temperature rise in rails.},

abstract={This letter studies remote state estimation under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. A sensor transmits its local estimate of an underlying physical process to a remote estimator via a wireless communication channel. A DoS attacker is capable to interfere the channel and degrades the remote estimation accuracy. Considering the tactical jamming strategies played by the attacker, the sensor adjusts its transmission power. This interactive process between the sensor and the attacker is studied in the framework of a zero-sum stochastic game. To derive their optimal power schemes, we first discuss the existence of stationary Nash equilibrium for this game. We then present the monotone structure of the optimal strategies, which helps reduce the computational complexity of the stochastic game algorithm. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the obtained results.},

abstract={The ability to discriminate between ballistic missile warheads and confusing objects is an important topic from different points of view. In particular, the high cost of the interceptors with respect to tactical missiles may lead to an ammunition problem. Moreover, since the time interval in which the defense system can intercept the missile is very short with respect to target velocities, it is fundamental to minimize the number of shoots per kill. For this reason, a reliable technique to classify warheads and confusing objects is required. In the efficient warhead classification system presented in this paper, a model and a robust framework is developed, which incorporates different micro-Doppler-based classification techniques. The reliability of the proposed framework is tested on both simulated and real data.},

For future deployed networks, the user experience can be improved with proper resource allocation mechanisms, taking into consideration quality of service characteristics of the traffic. Such a resource allocation method requires knowledge of the key performance indicators of the communication path. In this article, we present a framework for the key performance indicator estimation service for deployed heterogeneous networks. Our proposal utilizes several different approaches for measuring key performance indicators. Several mechanisms are used to improve the accuracy and reliability of the service.

abstract={Employment of ground-based positioning systems has been consistently growing over the past decades due to the growing number of applications that require location information where the conventional satellite-based systems have limitations. Such systems have been successfully adopted in the context of wireless emergency services, tactical military operations, and various other applications offering location-based services. In current and previous generation of cellular systems, i.e., 3G, 4G, and LTE, the base stations, which have known locations, have been assumed to be stationary and fixed. However, with the possibility of having mobile relays in 5G networks, there is a demand for novel algorithms that address the challenges that did not exist in the previous generations of localization systems. This paper includes a review of various fundamental techniques, current trends, and state-of-the-art systems and algorithms employed in wireless position estimation using moving receivers. Subsequently, performance criteria comparisons are given for the aforementioned techniques and systems. Moreover, a discussion addressing potential research directions when dealing with moving receivers, e.g., receiver's movement pattern for efficient and accurate localization, non-line-of-sight problem, sensor fusion, and cooperative localization, is briefly given.},

pages={980-989},
abstract={Underwater sensor networks (UWSNs) have been investigated in a variety of applications such as sea resources reconnaissance, pollution monitoring and tactical monitoring. In 3D underwater environments, it is a key topic to judge the localizability of sensor nodes given known locations of a small set of anchor nodes. In this paper, a novel localizability judgment method for UWSNs is proposed based on rigidity theory. A UWSN is modelled as an undirected graph based on acoustic connectivity. The graph is then reduced to a subgraph with global rigidity, called skeleton, from which the set of localizable sensors can determined. Furthermore, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to evaluate the localization confidence of localizable sensors. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed localizability judgment method can achieve low false negative rate and high efficiency networks of different sensor numbers and sensor densities. It is also shown to perform well in dynamic networks with relatively low waterflow speed.},

abstract={Underwater wireless information transfer is of great interest to the military, industry, and the scientific community, as it plays an important role in tactical surveillance, pollution monitoring, oil control and maintenance, offshore explorations, climate change monitoring, and oceanography research. In order to facilitate all these activities, there is an increase in the number of unmanned vehicles or devices deployed underwater, which require high bandwidth and high capacity for information transfer underwater. Although tremendous progress has been made in the field of acoustic communication underwater, however, it is limited by bandwidth. All this has led to the proliferation of underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC), as it provides higher data rates than the traditional acoustic communication systems with significantly lower power consumption and simpler computational complexities for short-range wireless links. UOWC has many potential applications ranging from deep oceans to coastal waters. However, the biggest challenge for underwater wireless communication originates from the fundamental characteristics of ocean or sea water; addressing these challenges requires a thorough understanding of complex physio-chemical biological systems. In this paper, the main focus is to understand the feasibility and the reliability of high data rate underwater optical links due to various propagation phenomena that impact the performance of the system. This paper provides an exhaustive overview of recent advances in UOWC. Channel characterization, modulation schemes, coding techniques, and various sources of noise which are specific to UOWC are discussed. This paper not only provides exhaustive research in underwater optical communication but also aims to provide the development of new ideas that would help in the growth of future underwater communication. A hybrid approach to an acousto-optic communication system is presented that complements the exist- ng acoustic system, resulting in high data rates, low latency, and an energy-efficient system.},

pages={818-830},
abstract={This paper presents a Mathematical Programming approach to optimize the scheduling of tanks in oil refineries. The considered problem is part of oil industry supply chain, where decisions are taken in strategic, tactical, and operational levels. The scheduling of tanks is part of the operational level and plays a fundamental role in integrating refinery production and transport operations. In particular, within the real-world studied scenario, a pipeline network is used to transport the derivatives, and the previously determined scheduling of pipelines is used as an input for the proposed model. Thus, the operational constraints and temporal issues from pipelines, which influence the transfer and storage refinery operations, are taken as assumptions within the proposed scheduling model for tanks. The proposed model is structured by a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation with a continuous time representation. The obtained results are evaluated by three main aspects: the respect of time-windows imposed by pipeline operations; by the storage profiles in tanks; and, by computational tests. The obtained results indicate the model's ability to propose a scheduling for refinery tanks that integrates the inherited scheduling of pipelines.},

abstract={Deployment of wireless devices with transceivers in close proximity to the ground has become increasingly attractive for a wide range of applications such as distributed sensor networks and broadband tactical communications. Furthermore, the use of ultrawideband (UWB) signals is attractive for these communications due to their robustness and their suitability for precision ranging and localization. For the development and performance simulation of such systems, accurate channel models are required. The current paper thus presents details of an extensive measurement campaign for near-ground UWB propagation channels and a channel model-based thereon. The measurements were performed with a self-built channel sounder based on arbitrary waveform generation at the transmitter, high-bandwidth sampling oscilloscope at the receiver, and synchronization via electro-optical connections. Various combinations for the antenna height at transmitter and receiver, ranging from 10 cm to 2 m above ground, were measured. We find that the pathloss coefficient (γ) depends significantly on the Tx-Rx antenna heights, while shadowing variance (σ2) and rms delay-spread (τrms) shows smaller dependence. The pathloss shows a slight dependence on frequency; the frequency-dependent pathloss exponent (κ) increases as antennas get closer to the ground. We also found a linear dependency of the rms delay-spread on distance for various antenna height configurations measured. Statistical distributions of all parameters including γ, τrms, σ2, and κ are extracted from the measurements. Results are verified by comparing with a second measurement campaign.},

abstract={In today's IT landscape, organizations are increasingly exposed to an array of novel and sophisticated threats-including advanced persistent threats (APTs) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks-which can bypass traditional defenses and persist in target systems indefinitely. Threat actors often rely on networks of compromised and remotely controlled hosts, known as botnets, to execute a number of different cyberattacks and engage in criminal or unauthorized activities. Protecting sensitive and mission-critical data from competitors, state actors, and organized crime has become increasingly critical for the well-being of many organizations. A promising approach to botnet detection and mitigation relies on moving target defense (MTD), a novel and game-changing approach to cyber defense. MTD creates asymmetric uncertainty, providing the defender with a tactical advantage over the attacker. MTD techniques are designed to continuously change or shift a system's attack surface, thus increasing cost and complexity for the threat actors. We show how the botnet detection and mitigation problem can be decomposed in three related and relatively simpler challenges, and how these challenges can be effectively tackled adopting an MTD approach, ultimately limiting the ability of a botnet to persist within a target system.},

abstract={A real-life military application of vehicle-to-grid/vehicle-to-vehicle (V2G–V2V)-based microgrid system is described in this paper. The system provides a plug-and-play, very fast forming, smart, aggregated, and efficient power solution for a contingency military base that can be setup in less than 20 min and is ready to generate up to 240 kW of 208-Y/120-VAC three-phase ( $3~Phi )$ power. The system uses vehicle transmission-integrated generators (TIGs) to produce 600-VDC power for use by vehicle hotel loads (i.e., electrification of nonpropulsion and auxiliary loads) and off-board loads (tents/shelters, communications centers, or other electrical loads). This effort involves four tactical military vehicles—two M1152 high-mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles equipped with 30 kW of on-board vehicle power and two MaxxPro dash mine resistant ambush protected vehicles equipped with 120-kW 3000 TIGs with V2G and V2V capabilities, four 60-kW dc-to-3 $Phi $ ac power converters with 600-VDC bus distribution systems and four 22.8-kWh energy storage units. Discussion of the methodology for power management for maximizing fuel economy is included at the end. This paper also includes some test results of subsystems and some results from modeling and simulation of the system. Our study demonstrates significant fuel economy benefits of using V2V-based system.},

abstract={Cooperative adaptive cruise control and platooning are well-known applications in the field of cooperative automated driving. However, extension toward maneuvering is desired to accommodate common highway maneuvers, such as merging, and to enable urban applications. To this end, a layered control architecture is adopted. In this architecture, the tactical layer hosts the interaction protocols, describing the wireless information exchange to initiate the vehicle maneuvers, supported by a novel wireless message set, whereas the operational layer involves the vehicle controllers to realize the desired maneuvers. This hierarchical approach was the basis for the Grand Cooperative Driving Challenge (GCDC), which was held in May 2016 in The Netherlands. The GCDC provided the opportunity for participating teams to cooperatively execute a highway lane-reduction scenario and an urban intersection-crossing scenario. The GCDC was set up as a competition and, hence, also involving assessment of the teams’ individual performance in a cooperative setting. As a result, the hierarchical architecture proved to be a viable approach, whereas the GCDC appeared to be an effective instrument to advance the field of cooperative automated driving.},

abstract={In modern warfare, as a long distance detection equipment, a reconnaissance radar is crucial to monitor the sensitive regions and the intelligence of airborne targets. It is important for the opponent to identify the tactical information about the enemy's reconnaissance radar. It has a great influence on the war. Scanning cycle of the monitoring radar is an important parameter for the counterreconnaissance of the hostile radar source in the electronic countermeasure. Since the pulse Doppler (PD) radar is one of the most widely used type in modern reconnaissance radar domains, this paper focuses on scanning cycle estimation of the reconnaissance radar (PD radar) using a single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). We propose an effective method to reconstruct the main-beam pattern (MBP) curve of the radar antenna based on the norm approximation algorithm, and then the reconstructed MBP curve of the radar antenna is exploited to estimate the scanning cycle of the reconnaissance radar. By hovering the UAV at the same place, the scanning cycle of the reconnaissance radar can be estimated according to the reconstructed MBP curve. In the simulation section, we check the validity and robustness of the proposed method through the performance comparison with the Cramer-Rao lower bound.},

abstract={Global air transport demand is increasing steadily, with the global revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) growing at an annual rate of 4% [1] and the number of passengers rising at an average annual rate of 10.6% [2]. By the end of 2016, it is estimated that 1,420 large commercial airliners will be produced, 40.5% more than was produced five years ago [2]. A consequence of this growth is an exacerbation of the existing global shortage of qualified pilots. Airlines have to hire more than 500,000 new commercial pilots until 2034 in order to meet this unprecedented air transport demand [3]. Additionally, the high costs associated with training and remuneration of pilots has been a substantial economic burden on air carriers, prompting active research into the concept of single-pilot operations (SPO) as an option for the future evolution of commercial airliners. SPO cockpits have already been developed for military fighters as well as general aviation (GA) aircraft, with small business jets like the Cessna Citation I obtaining approval for SPO as early as 1977 [4], however, the last decade has seen considerable interest in the implementation of SPO in commercial aviation. NASA has been conducting SPO-related studies since the mid-2000s [5], [6], while some recent research in Europe has focused on the technical [7] and operational [8] challenges of SPO. In the SPO concept of operations (Figure 1), a single pilot operates the flight deck with increased ground support from a dedicated ground human flight crew. The ground operators (GO) fulfil a role similar to that of a remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) operator, providing a combination of strategic and tactical support to the single pilot in collaboration with the air traffic controllers (ATCo).},

abstract={The rapid development of information technology paved the way for the recording of fine-grained data, such as stroke techniques and stroke placements, during a table tennis match. This data recording creates opportunities to analyze and evaluate matches from new perspectives. Nevertheless, the increasingly complex data poses a significant challenge to make sense of and gain insights into. Analysts usually employ tedious and cumbersome methods which are limited to watching videos and reading statistical tables. However, existing sports visualization methods cannot be applied to visualizing table tennis competitions due to different competition rules and particular data attributes. In this work, we collaborate with data analysts to understand and characterize the sophisticated domain problem of analysis of table tennis data. We propose iTTVis, a novel interactive table tennis visualization system, which to our knowledge, is the first visual analysis system for analyzing and exploring table tennis data. iTTVis provides a holistic visualization of an entire match from three main perspectives, namely, time-oriented, statistical, and tactical analyses. The proposed system with several well-coordinated views not only supports correlation identification through statistics and pattern detection of tactics with a score timeline but also allows cross analysis to gain insights. Data analysts have obtained several new insights by using iTTVis. The effectiveness and usability of the proposed system are demonstrated with four case studies.},

abstract={Analysts in professional team sport regularly perform analysis to gain strategic and tactical insights into player and team behavior. Goals of team sport analysis regularly include identification of weaknesses of opposing teams, or assessing performance and improvement potential of a coached team. Current analysis workflows are typically based on the analysis of team videos. Also, analysts can rely on techniques from Information Visualization, to depict e.g., player or ball trajectories. However, video analysis is typically a time-consuming process, where the analyst needs to memorize and annotate scenes. In contrast, visualization typically relies on an abstract data model, often using abstract visual mappings, and is not directly linked to the observed movement context anymore. We propose a visual analytics system that tightly integrates team sport video recordings with abstract visualization of underlying trajectory data. We apply appropriate computer vision techniques to extract trajectory data from video input. Furthermore, we apply advanced trajectory and movement analysis techniques to derive relevant team sport analytic measures for region, event and player analysis in the case of soccer analysis. Our system seamlessly integrates video and visualization modalities, enabling analysts to draw on the advantages of both analysis forms. Several expert studies conducted with team sport analysts indicate the effectiveness of our integrated approach.},

abstract={We define commensal sensors (CSs) as a class of EM sensor that use the emissions of other systems to fulfil their sensing function, without having any impact or collaboration with the emitter of opportunity. The jamming of CS systems, and possible Electronic Protection (EP) responses to such jamming have not received more than a passing reference in the open literature. The authors examine a specific case of a sensor exploiting FM Band transmissions, with a multi-receiver configuration (single transmit site, many spatially distributed receivers) and find that although modest jammer power can be very effective in jamming a single node of the CS, the unknown geometry and frequencies of operation of the CS will make it difficult to jam in practice. Simple null steering by the CS receivers is very effective. The authors also note that the CS sensor system requires excellent electronic support (ES) to be aware of electronic attack. The study reviews the tactical situation, and the very sparse literature. This is followed by some analysis of the effect of noise jamming, followed by simulations of jamming, with and without receiver null steering, as well as some self-protection jamming.},

pages={4287-4298},
abstract={Sensor networks deployed in high-latency environments, such as underwater acoustic and satellite channels, find critical applications in disaster prevention and tactical surveillance. The sensors in these networks have limited energy reserves. In order to extend the lifetime of these sensors, energy must be conserved in all layers of the protocol stack. In addition to long propagation delays, these channels are characterized by limited bandwidth and a lack of well-established closed-form analytical models. This fact makes finding cross-layer energy-optimal solutions a difficult problem to solve. Our goal is to compute near-optimal routes, schedules and transmit power levels for delay-constrained applications of high-latency sensor networks. We present a mixed-integer programming relaxation of the optimization problem. We further propose a decentralized algorithm to iteratively solve the relaxed optimization problem. Comparative simulation analysis shows that our decentralized approach is approximately 3~6 dB more energy-efficient and 2~5 dB more throughput-efficient than the heuristic, time-sensitive greedy forwarding, and least-cost routing algorithms.},

abstract={We develop and apply several novel methods quantifying dynamic multi-agent team interactions. These interactions are detected information-theoretically and captured in two ways: via (i) directed networks (interaction diagrams) representing significant coupled dynamics between pairs of agents, and (ii) state-space plots (coherence diagrams) showing coherent structures in Shannon information dynamics. This model-free analysis relates, on the one hand, the information transfer to responsiveness of the agents and the team, and, on the other hand, the information storage within the team to the team's rigidity and lack of tactical flexibility. The resultant interaction and coherence diagrams reveal implicit interactions, across teams, that may be spatially long-range. The analysis was verified with a statistically significant number of experiments (using simulated football games, produced during RoboCup 2D Simulation League matches), identifying the zones of the most intense competition, the extent and types of interactions, and the correlation between the strength of specific interactions and the results of the matches.},

abstract={In a highly competitive business environment, Cloud based enterprise resource planning (ERP) plays a crucial role for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to operate their business in a cost effect manner and yet deliver performance. The ability of a company to implement cloud ERP can be viewed as both strategic as well as tactical achievements. This tool integrates various business processes and thus it aids in real-time decision making. From cloud vendor's view-point compliance, network, and security play an important role in the implementation of cloud ERP. There are critical success factors (CSFs) that are crucial for a SME for successful cloud ERP implementation. This paper is aimed at proposing a link between the concerns of cloud vendor and the CSFs that are categorized as organizational, people, and technological factors. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to establish whether there is any moderating effect of compliance, network, and security on the CSFs for SMEs in India. Perspective of 208 respondents belonging to SMEs was taken into consideration and it was found that only the relationship of organizational factors with successful implementation of cloud ERP was moderated. There was no significant impact on the people factors and technological factors by the moderating variables compliance, network, and security.},

pages={206-220},
abstract={This two-part paper aims to study lane change behaviors at the tactical level from an on-road perspective. Compared with longitudinal driving tasks, a lane change is more complicated because this task has more interactions with surrounding vehicles; thus, there are more potential risks during this procedure. Based on the results from Part I on an on-road vehicle trajectory collection, this part investigates lane change extraction and scene-based behavior analysis, and it has a particular focus on understanding the interactions between an ego and surrounding vehicles during the procedure. We claim that this paper provides the following novel contributions: 1) an automatic method is proposed for extracting lane change segments from a continuous driving sequence by modeling and recognizing patterns in a steering angle; 2) a lane change database at the trajectory level is generated, which reflects the interactions between an ego and the surrounding vehicles during the procedures; and 3) we present findings from analyzing lane change procedures using real-world data on the axes of both the ego's trajectory and interactions with the scene vehicles. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first lane change behavior study from an on-road perspective that addresses the vehicle interactions in real-world traffic at the trajectory level.},

year={2016},

pages={1-12},
abstract={Integration of physical processes with the computing world is driving newer challenges for networking frameworks. Cyber physical social systems (CPSSs) are another upcoming paradigm that encompasses the ever-growing interaction between the physical, social, and cyber worlds. As communication networks form the basis of these interactions, a cognitive evaluation of networks is called for. This CPSS driven network evolution was a direction motivating this paper. With the implementation of the next generation networks, traffic from real-time interactive services, such as video conferencing, is surpassing those of conventional transactional services. As such multimedia data transportation over IP networks has stringent quality constraints in terms of required bandwidth, latency, and jitter, legacy networks with no quality of service face challenges in terms of performance. We attempt to perform a multivariate analysis of video call record data collected from a wide area organizational network over a period of time. Learning-based prediction is attempted by training four classifiers: naïve Bayes, $k$ -nearest neighbor, decision tree, and support vector machine. Two independent set of experiments were conducted with oversights of bandwidth and destination prediction. Both the discrete and continuous valued predictors were involved in the training. Performance evaluation of the generated hypothesis in both the cases was conducted using tenfold cross validation. Combined analysis using the assorted combinations of attributes was conducted, and thereafter, the effect of each feature was evaluated through singular attribute portioning. This paper presents observations, which exhibit deviations from the conventional machine learning paradigms. An attempt to increase the prediction accuracy of the classifiers was made through the boosting ensemble methodology. However, miniscule addition in performance was achieved. A maximum prediction accuracy of 81% for b- ndwidth and 60% for destination was obtained. Reasons of low accuracy of conventionally better performing algorithm were reasoned with a mathematical comprehension. Divergence of the obtained results from the accepted patterns poses an open research problem, particularly with respect to the nature and peculiarities of the data set. The proposed learning technique can have potential applications in social, tactical, and strategic spheres.},

abstract={Daily changes in the information security landscape mean that organizations face unprecedented challenges in securing their information systems. It appears easy for organizations to adopt a tactical approach in which they respond to problems as they occur. However, when such a paradigm exists, it becomes difficult to act strategically. What is required is for organizations to be able to assess their current maturity state with respect to information security governance and management, and to proactively identify problem areas that need to be addressed. Here, the authors present a capability maturity framework to support organizations in this activity. The framework addresses the technical, process, and human aspects of information security and provides insight and guidelines for organizations to implement effective information security governance and management processes.},

From Release 11 on, 3GPP has been developing and specifying dedicated nationwide public safety broadband networks that will be scalable, robust, and resilient, and can address the specific communication needs of emergency services. In this realm, the requirements and scenarios for isolated E-UTRAN with no or limited backhaul access to the core network are still in progress. In this article, we survey possible public safety use cases with the induced network topologies, discuss the current status of the 3GPP standards, and highlight future challenges. We further elaborate on the need to support mobile backhauling in moving-cell scenarios and describe two LTEbased solutions to enable dynamic meshing among the base stations.},

title={A Bandwidth Monitoring Strategy Under Uncertainty of the Adversary #x2019;s Activity},
year={2016},
volume={11},
number={4},
pages={837-849},
abstract={When an adversary illicitly uses spectrum that it is not authorized for, it does so with a purpose in mind, such as to download a file or perhaps engage in a real-time communication session. In this paper, we examine how the incorporation of knowledge related to an adversary's purpose can improve the effectiveness of spectrum scanning protocols. First, we study the difference in the thief's behavior when considering throughput and delay as the two primary QoS parameters he is concerned with. Through our analysis, we show that the detection probability of unlicensed access to spectrum resources depends on the application type. Knowledge of the application type can be incorporated to spectrum scanning to tune better it to detect the thief. To illustrate this, we examine two Bayesian games. In the first game, the scanner wants to minimize the time needed to detect the invader. In the second game, the scanner wants to maximize the detection probability at each time slot by adapting its belief regarding the adversary's activity. In particular, it is shown in the minimizing detection time game that the equilibrium strategies are continuous with respect to priori knowledge of the invader's activity. Meanwhile, for the maximizing detection probability game, the strategies can have a jump discontinuity. This phenomena can be explained as the difference between tactical and strategic decision making: tactical decision making allows short-term, unpredictable moves, while strategic decision making is inclined to predictable moves. Finally, since the bandwidth model used in this paper is general, the conclusion as well as the approach provided can be applied to a variety of different network protection problems.},

title={Multi-Objective Transit Route Network Design as Set Covering Problem},
year={2016},
volume={17},
number={3},
pages={670-679},
abstract={Many past researchers have ignored the multi-objective nature of the transit route network design problem (TrNDP), recognizing user or operator cost as their sole objective. The main purpose of this study is to identify the inherent conflict among TrNDP objectives in the design process. The conventional scheme for transit route design is addressed. A route constructive genetic algorithm is proposed to produce a vast pool of candidate routes that reflect the objectives of design, and then, a set covering problem (SCP) is formulated for the selection stage. A heuristic algorithm based on a randomized priority search is implemented for the SCP to produce a set of nondominated solutions that achieve different tradeoffs among the identified objectives. The solution methodology has been tested using Mandl's benchmark network problem. The test results showed that the methodology developed in this research not only outperforms solutions previously identified in the literature in terms of strategic and tactical terms of design, but it is also able to produce Pareto (or near Pareto) optimal solutions. A real-scale network of Rivera was also tested to prove the proposed methodology's reliability for larger-scale transit networks. Although many efficient meta-heuristics have been presented so far for the TrNDP, the presented one may take the lead because it does not require any weight coefficient calibration to address the multi-objective nature of the problem.},

abstract={Software architectures are often constructed through a series of design decisions. In particular, architectural tactics are selected to satisfy specific quality concerns such as reliability, performance, and security. However, the knowledge of these tactical decisions is often lost, resulting in a gradual degradation of architectural quality as developers modify the code without fully understanding the underlying architectural decisions. In this paper we present a machine learning approach for discovering and visualizing architectural tactics in code, mapping these code segments to tactic traceability patterns, and monitoring sensitive areas of the code for modification events in order to provide users with up-to-date information about underlying architectural concerns. Our approach utilizes a customized classifier which is trained using code extracted from fifty performance-centric and safety-critical open source software systems. Its performance is compared against seven off-the-shelf classifiers. In a controlled experiment all classifiers performed well; however our tactic detector outperformed the other classifiers when used within the larger context of the Hadoop Distributed File System. We further demonstrate the viability of our approach for using the automatically detected tactics to generate viable and informative messages in a simulation of maintenance events mined from Hadoop's change management system.},

abstract={Ongoing technological advances in the areas of computation, sensing, and mechatronics enable robotic-based systems to interact with humans in the real world. To succeed against a human in a competitive scenario, a robot must anticipate the human behavior and include it in its own planning framework. Then it can predict the next human move and counter it accordingly, thus not only achieving overall better performance but also systematically exploiting the opponent's weak spots. Pool is used as a representative scenario to derive a model-based planning and control framework where not only the physics of the environment but also a model of the opponent is considered. By representing the game of pool as a Markov decision process and incorporating a model of the human decision-making based on studies, an optimized policy is derived. This enables the robot to include the opponent's typical game style into its tactical considerations when planning a stroke. The results are validated in simulations and real-life experiments with an anthropomorphic robot playing pool against a human.},

abstract={We introduce a technique of calibrating camera motions in basketball videos. Our method particularly transforms player positions to standard basketball court coordinates and enables applications such as tactical analysis and semantic basketball video retrieval. To achieve a robust calibration, we reconstruct the panoramic basketball court from a video, followed by warping the panoramic court to a standard one. As opposed to previous approaches, which individually detect the court lines and corners of each video frame, our technique considers all video frames simultaneously to achieve calibration; hence, it is robust to illumination changes and player occlusions. To demonstrate the feasibility of our technique, we present a stroke-based system that allows users to retrieve basketball videos. Our system tracks player trajectories from broadcast basketball videos. It then rectifies the trajectories to a standard basketball court by using our camera calibration method. Consequently, users can apply stroke queries to indicate how the players move in gameplay during retrieval. The main advantage of this interface is an explicit query of basketball videos so that unwanted outcomes can be prevented. We show the results in Figs. 1, 7, 9, 10 and our accompanying video to exhibit the feasibility of our technique.},

pages={244-255},
abstract={The impact of game content on the player experience is potentially more critical in casual games than in competitive games because of the diminished role of strategic or tactical diversions. Interestingly, until now procedural content generation (PCG) has nevertheless been investigated almost exclusively in the context of competitive, skills-based gaming. This paper therefore opens a new direction for PCG by placing it at the center of an entirely casual flower-breeding game platform called Petalz. That way, the behavior of players and their reactions to different game mechanics in a casual environment driven by PCG can be investigated. In particular, players in Petalz can: 1) trade their discoveries in a global marketplace; 2) respond to an incentive system that awards diversity; and 3) generate real-world 3-D replicas of their evolved flowers. With over 1900 registered online users and 38 646 unique evolved flowers, Petalz showcases the potential for PCG to enable these kinds of casual game mechanics, thus paving the way for continued innovation with PCG in casual gaming.},

abstract={The common SHOOT-LOOK-SHOOT method, in which a second round of defenders is launched based on the kill assessment of the first round of defenders, is usually efficient in defending strategic or tactical targets against a salvo attack. However, using this method is not always practical due to time constraints. In the presented study, the alternative SHOOT-SHOOT-LOOK method is investigated, and an algorithm for its implementation is derived. Solutions to three main problems that arise while applying this method are presented: finding the optimal locations of the defending missiles for the second SHOOT stage, updating the locations of the defenders during the LOOK stage, and deriving the optimal allocation plan of the defending missiles to the attacking missiles. The solutions are based on a probabilistic analysis of the expected miss distance, between each pair of defender and attacker, which is dependent on the guidance law of the defender and geometry of the engagement. The results show that the algorithm can increase the probability of the defended target surviving the salvo attack, or alternatively, it can reduce the number of defenders needed to reach a given level of protection.},

abstract={The articles in this special section focus on military application communications.Information sharing is the key concept of network-centric military operations. As the complexity of operational environments increases, military communications networks must be agile to meet strict and evolving mission requirements in the midst of challenges presented by dynamic operational environments. The RF spectrum, for example, is a limited resource, which can be utilized better and in a more flexible way through the use of software defined networking and cognitive radios. Tactical communications encompasses all communication technologies used in the battlefield, constituting a heterogeneous collection of approaches and technologies. To assist in timely and accurate decision making, rapid information sharing is an important aspect of information superiority. Machine learning techniques can be used to analyze large streams of data, but military communications must ensure the security of the data and techniques.},

abstract={With the advances in vehicle and sensor technologies, there is a growing interest in the design and deployment of Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs). A typical UASN employs underwater nodes, surface sinks, autonomous underwater vehicles and low-power gliders to collaboratively perform underwater operating missions. For the ease of deployment as well as the ability in intellectualization information processing, UASNs are envisioned to enable marine applications for oceanographic data collection, pollution monitoring, offshore exploration, disaster prevention, assisted navigation and tactical surveillance. Compared with traditional monitoring technologies, e.g., remote sensing or sonar sweeping, USANs have clear advantages in terms of infrastructureless, real-time, high-precision and low-cost detection.},

abstract={Millimeter-wave transceivers will feature massive phased-array antennas whose pencilbeams can be steered toward the angle of arrival of the propagation path having the maximum power, exploiting their high gain to compensate for the greater path loss witnessed in the upper spectrum. For this reason, maximum-power path-loss models, in contrast to conventional ones based on the integrated power from an omnidirectional antenna, may be more relevant. Yet to our knowledge, they do not appear in the literature save for one reference. In this paper, we compare both model types at 83.5 GHz for four indoor environments typical of hotspot deployments in line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS conditions up to a range of 160 m. To fit the models, we conducted a measurement campaign with over 3000 different transmitter-receiver configurations using a custom-designed channel sounder capable of extracting the delay and 3-D angle of arrival of the received paths with super-resolution. The models are supported by a detailed analysis of the propagation mechanisms of direct transmission, reflection, and knife-edge diffraction to shed light on their interplay in the E-band regime.},

pages={4343-4354},
abstract={This paper considers a distributed wave-based sensing system that probes a scene consisting of multiple interacting idealized targets. Each sensor is a collocated transmit-receive pair that is capable of transmitting arbitrary wideband waveforms. We address the problem of finding the space-time transmit waveform that provides the best target detection performance in the sense of maximizing the energy scattered back into the receivers. Our approach is based on earlier theoretical work that showed, for an idealized infinite half-space geometry, that the solution could be constructed by an iterative time-reversal (TR) process. In this paper, we give a more realistic example involving a two-sensor time-domain system. We show that for this system, the iterative TR process can be used to tune automatically to all the target resonances that are within the bandwidth of the interrogating radar system. We show that although obtaining eigenvalues (and hence resonances) of the scattering operator is in general unstable, using the iterative TR process to obtain the resonances is a stable process. Moreover, we show that these resonance frequencies are connected to the poles of the singularity expansion method.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a nonlinear multiconductor transmission line model to analyze the time-domain and nonlinear responses of broadband switching metamaterials. This analysis employs coupled transmission lines loaded with nonlinear elements to model the response of the metamaterial structures to a vertically polarized free-space excitation. Using this analysis we first examine the time-domain response of a broadband switching metamaterial structure loaded with high-speed Schottky diodes. We then show that this structure's response to incident power can be effectively inverted by replacing these Schottky diodes with varactor diodes. Experimental results are presented for both structures in WR-284 waveguide, which show good agreement with results generated from full-wave and transmission line analysis. We also use the circuit model to simulate power-dependent material parameters and both the input and output third-order intercept point for both the Schottky-loaded and varactor-loaded metamaterials.},

abstract={We introduce competing cognitive resilient network (CCRN) of mobile radios challenged to optimize data throughput and networking efficiency under dynamic spectrum access and adversarial threats (e.g., jamming). Unlike the conventional approaches, CCRN features both communicator and jamming nodes in a friendly coalition to take joint actions against hostile networking entities. In particular, this paper showcases hypothetical blue force and red force CCRNs and their competition for open spectrum resources. We present state-agnostic and stateful solution approaches based on the decision theoretic framework. The state-agnostic approach builds on multiarmed bandit to develop an optimal strategy that enables the exploratory-exploitative actions from sequential sampling of channel rewards. The stateful approach makes an explicit model of states and actions from an underlying Markov decision process and uses multiagent Q-learning to compute optimal node actions. We provide a theoretical framework for CCRN and propose new algorithms for both approaches. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithms outperform some of the most important algorithms known to date.},

pages={8459-8474},
abstract={The topic of subcarrier and power allocation in the downlink of an orthogonal frequency division multiple access decode-and-forward relaying system is presented with the objective of encompassing system stability and interference limitations in one inclusive problem. The introduced model is designed to maximize the overall throughput of the cell-edge users that are served by relay stations. We analyze the stability requirement of buffers in the base station and the corresponding relay stations, and define the rate constraints in order to guarantee queue stability without requiring a priori knowledge of arrival traffic's statistics. The explained model results in a nonconvex optimization problem, and therefore, we employ a time-shared technique to achieve the closed form solution, which is only applicable when subcarriers can be shared by the users during one time-slot. In the case where the subcarriers are not allowed to be time-shared, we introduce a computationally efficient optimal binary subcarrier and power allocation method, in addition to a power conservative allocation mechanism. Using geometric-programming and monomial approximation techniques, we show that the proposed conservative approach, although nonconvex, can be solved in polynomial time. We also study the impact of adjustable time-slot division and interference-tolerance parameters on improving system performance. The extensive simulation results demonstrate the success of the proposed methods in terms of stabilizing the queues, improving the throughput by 30% and energy efficiency gain by 90%, in comparison with the existing similar models in the literature.},

To alleviate this problem, we propose a machine-learning-based geographic routing scheme to reduce network overhead in high-mobility scenarios.

abstract={This paper proposes a new robust security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) method to balance the economy. and security requirements under uncertainties associated with renewable generation and load demand. Given the significant growth in microgrid (MG) deployments over the world, this paper explores the potential of using multiple MGs in supporting main grid's security control. Corrective control is employed to relieve postcontingency overflows by effectively coordinating system generators and multiple MGs. An incentive-based mechanism is designed to encourage the MGs to actively cooperate with the main grid for postcontingency recovery, which makes the proposed method to distinguish from the previous models using a traditional centralized control method, such as direct load control. A scenario-decomposition-based approach is then developed to solve the proposed robust SCOPF problem. Numerical simulations on IEEE 14- and IEEE 118-bus systems demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.},

abstract={By relying on a wireless backhaul link, relay stations enhance the performance of cellular networks by achieving the required reliability at a savings of infrastructure cost and energy, but at the same time, they can aggravate the interference issue. In this paper, we analyze the maximum energy gain provided by relays for several coding schemes, including energy-optimized partial decode-forward relaying, accounting for the additional relay-generated interference to neighboring cells. First, we define new energy-efficient service areas for relaying in log-normal shadowing environments and propose easily computable and tractable models to predict: 1) the probability of energy-efficient relaying; 2) the spatial distribution of energy consumption within a cell; and 3) the average interference generated by relays. These models allow finding the optimal location and the number of relays with significantly lower complexity and execution time, as compared with system simulations. Finally, we analyze the gains provided by more advanced relaying coding schemes and propose a map showing how to use them across a cell, as a function of their respective circuitry consumption. The inclusion of more advanced relaying schemes not only alleviates the interference issue, but also leads to a reduction in the number of relays required for the same rate and outage performance.},

abstract={This paper proposes a robust optimization approach for optimal operation of microgrids. The uncertain output variation of renewable energy sources (RESs) is addressed by collaboratively scheduling of energy storage (ES) and direct load control (DLC) through a two-stage complementary framework: an hour-ahead charging/discharging of ES and a quarter-hour-ahead activation of DLC. The objective is to maximize the total profit of the microgrid considering operation and maintenance costs of ES units, wind turbines and photovoltaics, and transaction with main grid and customer loads. Assuming the power output of RES randomly varies within a bounded uncertainty set, the problem is modeled to a two-stage robust optimization model and solved by a column-and-constraint generation algorithm. Compared with conventional operation methods, the ES and DLC are coordinated in different time-scales, and RES uncertainties are fully addressed during operation decision-making, ensuring the solutions to be optimal and robust for any realization of uncertainty. The proposed methodology is verified on the IEEE 33-bus distribution system through a wide range of different tests.},

year={2016},
volume={4},

pages={5196-5208},
abstract={In this paper, we consider a network in which lower power nodes (LPNs) are deployed jointly within macrocells. However, there are significant differences between the transmit power levels, coverage areas, and deployment densities of these two types of base stations. Such disparities lead to an unfair load distribution, as well as a lower throughput for picocells'users equipments (UEs). A good solution to such issues is the exploitation of the cell range expansion (CRE) technique. Although CRE has widely proven its effectiveness, it may degrade the network capacity if the cell bias is not chosen properly. In fact, it may generate severe intercell interference at extended region cell (ERC) UEs, which leads to a deterioration of their throughput. We thus propose a downlink coordinated cell range expansion for mobility management (CCREMM) strategy that analytically computes the joint optimal bias at picocells and macrocells. CCREMM mitigates the interference at ERC-UEs by accounting for their maximum tolerable interference. Moreover, CCREMM reaches the load balancing and the UE QoS satisfaction by accounting for additional parameters. It will be proven that our strategy which is associated with the maximum throughput scheduling technique, results in a cell load-balancing improvement, fairness, and a 50-90% UE throughput enhancement. These performance figures are shown to surpass those achieved by alternative approaches proposed in the existing literature.},

abstract={With the dense deployment of small cells in the next generation of mobile networks, the users from different tiers suffer from high downlink interferences. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic approach for joint co-tier and cross-tier collaboration in heterogeneous networks and analyze the relevance of the proposed scheme. First, we propose a coalition structure game with a weighted Owen value as imputation, where the small-cell base stations (SBSs) and their connecting macrocell user equipments (MUEs) form a priori union. We prove that the proposed framework optimizes the users profit. As an additional global benefit, the SBSs are encouraged to host the harmed public users in their vicinity. Second, we propose a canonical game with a weighted solidarity value as imputation to allow cooperation among SBSs and MUEs when they fail to connect to nearby SBSs. We prove that the weak players are protected in this scheme and that a high degree of fairness is provided in the game. We compare through extensive simulations the proposed frameworks with state-of-the-art resource allocation solutions, access modes, and legacy game-theoretic approaches. We show that the proposed framework obtains the best performances for the MUEs and small-cells user equipments in terms of throughput and fairness. Throughput gain is in order of 40% even reaching 50% for both types of users.},

abstract={Machine learning (ML) has been widely applied to the upper layers of wireless communication systems for various purposes, such as deployment of cognitive radio and communication network. However, its application to the physical layer is hampered by sophisticated channel environments and limited learning ability of conventional ML algorithms. Deep learning (DL) has been recently applied for many fields, such as computer vision and natural language processing, given its expressive capacity and convenient optimization capability. The potential application of DL to the physical layer has also been increasingly recognized because of the new features for future communications, such as complex scenarios with unknown channel models, high speed and accurate processing requirements; these features challenge conventional communication theories. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the emerging studies on DL-based physical layer processing, including leveraging DL to redesign a module of the conventional communication system (for modulation recognition, channel decoding, and detection) and replace the communication system with a radically new architecture based on an autoencoder. These DL-based methods show promising performance improvements but have certain limitations, such as lack of solid analytical tools and use of architectures that are specifically designed for communication and implementation research, thereby motivating future research in this field.},

abstract={The framework of cognitive wireless networks is expected to endow the wireless devices with the cognition-intelligence ability with which they can efficiently learn and respond to the dynamic wireless environment. In many practical scenarios, the complexity of network dynamics makes it difficult to determine the network evolution model in advance. Thus, the wireless decision-making entities may face a black-box network control problem and the model-based network management mechanisms will be no longer applicable. In contrast, model-free learning enables the decision-making entities to adapt their behaviors based on the reinforcement from their interaction with the environment and (implicitly) build their understanding of the system from scratch through trial-and-error. Such characteristics are highly in accordance with the requirement of cognition-based intelligence for devices in cognitive wireless networks. Therefore, model-free learning has been considered as one key implementation approach to adaptive, self-organized network control in cognitive wireless networks. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the applications of the state-of-the-art model-free learning mechanisms in cognitive wireless networks. According to the system models on which those applications are based, a systematic overview of the learning algorithms in the domains of single-agent system, multiagent systems, and multiplayer games is provided. The applications of model-free learning to various problems in cognitive wireless networks are discussed with the focus on how the learning mechanisms help to provide the solutions to these problems and improve the network performance over the model-based, non-adaptive methods. Finally, a broad spectrum of challenges and open issues is discussed to offer a guideline for the future research directions.},

abstract={We introduce a generative model, dubbed I/O HSMM, for learning the bi-modal behavioral dynamics of a network of cognitive radios (CRs). Each of the two modes of the CRs is represented as a Hidden Semi-Markov model (HSMM), where the states, state durations and emissions, transition probabilities between states, and transitions between modes are uncovered based solely on RF spectrum sensing. The learning of the CR dynamics is non-parametric and derived from the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP), with the switching between the two modes modeled as a latent variable that is estimated as a part of the learning process. The non-parametric model provides flexibility in handling unknown communication protocols. We evaluate the quality of learning against ground truth, and demonstrate that this approach is promising and merits extension to more complex models.},

abstract={In the existing distributed cooperative spectrum sensing scheme, the nodes that participate in the cooperative operation are predetermined. However, the nodes in the deep fading wireless environment usually corrupt the performance of cooperative sensing. To deal with this problem, we propose a node selection based distributed cooperative compressive spectrum sensing (NS-DCS) algorithm for wideband cognitive radio network (CRN). In this scheme, we first use Bayesian network learning to remove the redundant nodes based on the compressive data collected from the different cognitive radio (CR) users in a fading environment. And then we employ a proposed weighted average consensus-based distributed cooperative compressive spectrum sensing algorithm with the prior parameter exchange (PE-WDS) to identify the occupied spectrum. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme can improve the accuracy of wideband cooperative spectrum sensing.},

abstract={The development of cognitive wireless technologies is a key enabler of automatic coexistence of industrial communication applications in the industrial scientific medical (ISM) bands. This is crucial for achieving the flexibility required in the so-called Industrie 4.0. In this work we present a single channel cognitive medium access control (MAC) protocol for wireless industrial communication in highly dynamic shared environments. The protocol design utilizes traffic models based on measurements of industrial wireless traffic in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. The proposed protocol enables optimum spectrum use and throughput by equipping nodes with predictive channel access. We address the problem of predictive channel access where cognitive networks are 1) either aware only of non-cognitive networks or 2) aware of other cognitive networks as well due to continuous online learning. The proposed protocol supports service differentiation, i.e. critical industrial applications could be assigned higher priorities when accessing the channel in order to fulfill their strict delay requirements. We also develop a highly accurate theoretical framework for predictive channel access and validate the proposed framework through extensive simulations. Simulation results show optimal throughput and spectrum use and a significant improvement on WiFi's Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA).},

In this work we study the adaptation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to the problem of identifying coexisting wireless devices. We develop a machine learning conduit to facilitate the detection and identification of frequency domain signatures for 802.x standard compliant technologies. Spectrum scans across the entire ISM region (80-MHz) are recorded and a data-driven training process for a wide range of Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) is completed.

abstract={From the attenuation measurements collected by a network of spatially distributed sensors, radio tomography constructs spatial loss fields (SLFs) that quantify absorption of radiofrequency waves at each location. These SLFs can be used for interference prediction in (possibly cognitive) wireless communication networks, for environmental monitoring or intrusion detection in surveillance applications, for through-the-wall imaging, for survivor localization after earthquakes or fires, etc. The cornerstone of radio tomography is to model attenuation as the bidimensional integral of the SLF of interest scaled by a weight function. Unfortunately, existing approaches (i) rely on heuristic assumptions to select the weight function and (ii) are limited to imaging changes in the propagation medium or they require a separate calibration step with measurements in free space. The first major contribution in this paper addresses (i) by means of a blind radio tomographic approach that learns the SLF together with the aforementioned weight function from the attenuation measurements. This challenging problem is tackled by capitalizing on contemporary kernel-based learning tools together with various forms of regularization that leverage prior knowledge. The second contribution addresses (ii) by means of a novel calibration technique capable of imaging static structures without separate calibration steps. Numerical tests with real and synthetic measurements validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.},

abstract={With the increasing presence of cognitive radio networks as a means to address limited spectral resources, improved wireless security has become a necessity. In particular, the potential of a node to impersonate a licensed user demonstrates the need for techniques to authenticate a radio's true identity. In this paper, we use deep learning to detect physical-layer attributes for the identification of cognitive radio devices, and demonstrate the performance of our method on a set of IEEE 802.15.4 devices. Our method is based on the empirical principle that manufacturing variability among wireless transmitters that conform to the same standard creates unique, repeatable signatures in each transmission, which can then be used as a fingerprint for device identification and verification. We develop a framework for training a convolutional neural network using the time-domain complex baseband error signal and demonstrate 92.29% identification accuracy on a set of seven 2.4 GHz commercial ZigBee devices. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios.},

abstract={Cognitive radio (CR) enables unlicensed users to sense for and access underutilized licensed channels (or white spaces) owned by the licensed users in an opportunistic manner. Clustering segregates nodes in a network into logical groups called clusters. In CR networks (CRNs), larger cluster size improves network scalability thereby contributing to reduced routing overhead; however, it reduces cluster stability as the number of available common channels in a cluster reduces resulting in increased number of re-clusterings and clustering overhead. This paper presents our proposed first-of-its-kind cluster size adjustment scheme based on an artificial intelligence approach called reinforcement learning. The proposed scheme adapts the cluster size with the amount of white spaces as time goes by in order to improve network scalability and cluster stability in CRNs. Due to the lack of progress in the investigation of cluster size adjustment schemes in the literature, this paper also analyzes their attributes, and then presents such schemes investigated in various kinds of distributed wireless networks. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme improves network scalability by creating larger clusters, and improves cluster stability by reducing the number of re-clusterings (i.e., the number of cluster splits) and clustering overhead, while reducing interference between licensed and unlicensed users in CRNs.},

abstract={Cognitive networks (CNs) are one of the key enablers for the Internet of Things (IoT), where CNs will play an important role in the future internet in several application scenarios, such as healthcare, agriculture, environment monitoring, and smart metering. However, the current low packet transmission efficiency of IoT faces a problem of the crowded spectrum for the rapidly increasing popularities of various wireless applications. Hence, the IoT that uses the advantages of cognitive technology, namely the cognitive radio-based Internet of Things (CIoT), is a promising solution for IoT applications. A major challenge in CIoT is the packet transmission efficiency using CNs. Therefore, a new Q-learning-based transmission scheduling mechanism using deep learning for the CIoT is proposed to solve the problem of how to achieve the appropriate strategy to transmit packets of different buffers through multiple channels to maximize the system throughput. A Markov decision process based model is formulated to describe the state transformation of the system. A relay is used to transmit packets to the sink for the other nodes. To maximize the system utility in different system states, the reinforcement learning method, i.e., the Q learning algorithm, is introduced to help the relay to find the optimal strategy. In addition, the stacked auto-encoders deep learning model is used to establish the mapping between the state and the action to accelerate the solution of the problem. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the new action selection method can converge after a certain number of iterations. Compared with other algorithms, the proposed method can better transmit packets with less power consumption and packet loss.},

An example of a community could range from spectators in a sports arena to ad hoc vehicular networks to a community in a neighbourhood sharing common interests. This chapter explores the synergy between ML and cognitive radio systems. Based on this exploration, we will formulate novel algorithms to share spectrum through dynamic spectrum leasing methodologies and adaptive policy decision making processes that seek to maximize the utilization of available scarce spectrum. This exploration will also lead to a better understanding of the traditional CR techniques and to an integrated approach that will formulate cognitive cycles at multiple levels of a system and to cross cognitive cycle approaches that will lead to further efficiencies in spectrum utilization. The research will also facilitate a tighter coupling between CR theories and ML theories and lead to new theoretical analyses and novel algorithms that could bring about greater synergy between wireless networks and computer science.},

abstract={In this paper, big Radio Frequency (RF) data assisted optimization is considered for future wireless networks employing cognitive radio technology with machine learning capability. A cognitive radio network (CRN) with multiple Secondary Users (SUs) may coexist with other wireless systems such as Small Cells (SC) and Radar systems, both Primary Users (PUs) with different level of priorities. Traditional spectrum sensing typically only gives information about the presence or absence of a PU. However, when multiple heterogeneous systems coexist, it becomes imperative to acquire the knowledge of the systems operating in a specific band at a particular time so as to choose an appropriate transmission strategy. In this work, we take advantage of the learning capability of a Neural Network Predictor (NNP) to obtain the statistics of the coexisted wireless systems from the RF traces collected in our Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) based test bed. The NNP is able to learn the features of the RF traces and make accurate prediction of the signals prevalent in the wireless environment. Because of the augmented information learned from the RF traces, a novel optimization problem incorporating the outputs from the NNP is formulated to maximize the throughput of the CRN. The solution is derived using Karush- Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) and extensive simulations using the real RF traces are carried out. It is demonstrated that the NNP can detect the type and number of coexisted users reliably and the proposed scheme will improve the performance of the coexisted CRN.},

abstract={Cognitive radio (CR) is a promising technology for future wireless spectrum allocation to improve the use of licensed bands. However, security challenges faced by cognitive radio technology are still a hot research topic. One of prevailing challenges is the radio frequency jamming attack, where adversaries are able to exploit on-the-fly reconfigurability potentials and learning mechanism of cognitive radios in order to devise and deploy advanced jamming tactics. Jamming attacks can significantly impact the performance of wireless communication systems and lead to significant overheads in terms of retransmission and increment of power consumption. In this context, a novel jammer detection algorithm is proposed using cyclic spectral analysis and artificial neural networks (ANN) for wide-band (WB) cognitive radios. The proposed approach assumes a WB spectrum occupied by various narrow-band (NB) signals, which can be either legitimate or jamming signals. The second order statistics, namely, the spectral correlation function (SCF) and ANN are used to classify each NB signal as a legitimate or jamming signal. The algorithm performance is shown with the help of simulations.},

abstract={IEEE 802.22 wireless regional area networks promotes the use of TV white spaces to provide wireless broadband access to rural area using cognitive radio techniques. While selecting the best unused channel for transmission, a secondary user (SU) can use various parameters, among which the probability of appearance of the primary user (PU) in the channel. If that probability is high, the SU has to vacate the channel quickly when the PU will appear. This increases the hand-off and degrades the throughput. In this paper, the probability of appearance of a PU in a particular channel is predicted using an artificial neural network learning technique that learns the previous behavior of the PU. Simulation results are presented, showing that our proposed approach can be well fitted with the Mean Square Error (MSE) method as low as 0.08.},

abstract={We explore machine learning pattern recognition techniques as a means of informing intelligent secondary user dynamic spectrum access (DSA) strategies in a cognitive radio environment. We present a framework for learning and inferring primary user protocol state at the application and MAC layers from simple energy detector features. The resulting knowledge about the primary user protocol can be exploited by a secondary user to identify access opportunities, and to recognize when secondary user traffic has disrupted the normal behavior of the primary user. We apply Bayesian nonparametric structure learning techniques to construct Hidden Markov Models (HMM) representing primary user wireless network traffic. The learned HMM models have a highly interpretable hidden state structure that provides insight into the actual state machine of the underlying communication protocol. This framework provides efficient procedures for online protocol classification and state inference that enable the secondary user to reason intelligently about the primary user environment, and develop more efficient and adaptive DSA policies. Experimental results obtained on a wireless network testbed show that our approach learns hidden states that correspond to actual primary user application layer protocol states and also detects anomalous primary user behavior caused by secondary user interference.},

abstract={In this paper, we quantify the trustworthiness of secondary nodes that share spectrum sensing reports in a distributed dynamic spectrum access network. We propose a spatio-spectral anomaly monitoring technique that effectively captures anomalies in the spectrum sensing reports shared by individual cognitive radio nodes. Based on this, we propose an optimistic trust model for a system with a normal risk attitude and using approximation to the Beta distribution. For a more conservative and risk averse system, we propose a multinomial Dirichlet distribution-based conservative trust framework. Using a machine learning approach, we classify malicious nodes with a high degree of certainty regardless of their aggressiveness of attacks or variations introduced by the wireless environment. Subsequently, we propose two instantaneous fusion models: 1) optimistic trust-based fusion and 2) conservative trust-based fusion, which exclude untrustworthy sensing reports from participating nodes during spectrum data fusion. Our work considers random, deterministic, and preferential (ON-OFF) attack models to demonstrate the utility of our proposed model under varied attack scenarios. Through extensive simulation experiments, we show that the trust values help identify malicious nodes with a high degree of certainty.},

abstract={Cognitive radio (CR) system being an intelligence-based communication device has been considered as the next generation emerging technologies to Wireless Communication Systems (WCS). This CR's embedded-intelligent agent is called Cognitive Engine (CE), and is responsible for the dynamic adaptation between the WCS's environment and the radio operational parameters. As a result of CR's intelligence capability, the WCS's quality of service (QoS) and its connectivity operations get enhanced. In order to evaluate the CR engine performance in respect to its learning, timing, and its computational performances. This paper proposes an alternative state-of-the-art enhanced CR learning engine based on Random Neural Network (RNN). Unlike Artificial Neural Network (ANN) systems, RNN establishes strong data generalization, converges faster and produces relatively smaller levels of prediction errors. Subjected to similar environmental conditions, the simulation cumulative results show that the performance of the proposed RNN system is satisfactory and produces 36.895% performance improvement above the ANN learning engine.},

abstract={Channel gain cartography relies on sensor measurements to construct maps providing the attenuation between arbitrary transmitter-receiver locations. A number of applications involving interference control, such as wireless network planning or cognitive radio, can benefit from channel gain maps. Existing approaches capitalize on tomographic models, where shadowing is the weighted integral of a spatial loss field (SLF) that depends on the propagation environment. Currently, the SLF is learned from sensor measurements whereas functions weighting the SLF are heuristically selected, but the effectiveness of the latter remains unclear. This paper leverages the framework of nonparametric regression in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to propose an algorithm that relies on the same sensor measurements as existing approaches to learn not only the SLF but also the associated weight function. Such an algorithm therefore constitutes a universal tool for channel gain cartography while revealing the nature of the propagation medium. An optimization method is proposed to minimize the pertinent criterion with closed-form updates. Simulation tests demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract={User mobility has become a key attribute in the design of optimal resource allocation policies for future wireless networks. This has become increasingly apparent in cognitive radio (CR) systems where the licensed, primary users (PUs) of the network must be protected from harmful interference by the network's opportunistic, secondary users (SUs): here, unpredictability due to mobility requires the implementation of safety net mechanisms that are provably capable of adapting to changes in the users' wireless environment. In this context, we propose a distributed learning algorithm that allows SUs to adjust their power allocation profile (over the available frequency carriers) “on the fly”, relying only on strictly causal channel state information. To account for the interference caused to the network's PUs, we incorporate a penalty function in the rate-driven objectives of the SUs, and we show that the proposed scheme matches asymptotically the performance of the best fixed power allocation policy in hindsight. Specifically, in a system with S orthogonal subcarriers and transmission horizon T, this performance gap (known as the algorithm's average regret) is bounded from above as O(T-1 logS). We also validate our theoretical analysis with numerical simulations which confirm that the network's SUs rapidly achieve a “no-regret” state under realistic wireless cellular conditions. Moreover, by finetuning the choice of penalty function, the interference induced by the SUs can be kept at a sufficiently low level, thus guaranteeing the PUs' requirements.},

pages={330-345}, 
abstract={Agents in networks often encounter circumstances requiring them to make decisions. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the decisions may be uncertain due to the unknown system state and the uncontrollable externality. The uncertainty can be eliminated through learning from information sources, such as user-generated contents or revealed actions. Nevertheless, the user-generated contents could be untrustworthy since other agents may maliciously create misleading contents for their selfish interests. The passively revealed actions are potentially more trustworthy and also easier to be gathered through simple observations. In this paper, we propose a new stochastic game-theoretic framework, Hidden Chinese Restaurant Game (H-CRG), to utilize the passively revealed actions in stochastic social learning process. We propose grand information extraction, a novel Bayesian belief extraction process, to extract the belief on the hidden information directly from the observed actions. We utilize the coupling relation between belief and policy to transform the original continuous belief-state Markov decision process (MDP) into a discrete-state MDP. The optimal policy is then analyzed in both centralized and game-theoretic approaches. We demonstrate how the proposed H-CRG can be applied to the channel access problem in cognitive radio networks. We then conduct data-driven simulations using the CRAWDAD Dartmouth campus wireless local area network (WLAN) trace. The simulation results show that the equilibrium strategy derived in H-CRG provides higher expected utilities for new users and maintains a reasonable high social welfare comparing with other candidate strategies.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have a potential for a wide scope of uses in the real-world environment. However, WSN application development is considered a challenging and complex task because of the complexity in low-level details, which a developer must deal with. Besides most of the current application development is done using node-centric, low-level languages such as C. In order to make the WSN technology more ubiquitous, application development complexity needs to be reduced, and development efficiency increased. This paper describes SenNet language, which is a new approach to WSN application development using a Domain-Specific Language (DSL). SenNet empowers application developers by allowing them to focus on modelling the application logic rather than the programming and low-level technical details. The new approach gives the ability to write applications using multi-abstraction levels (i.e. network, group, and node-level). Furthermore, evaluation results show that SenNet reduces the cognitive effort needed for learning WSN application development in addition to the time required to write the application by using automated code generation from abstracted language commands.},

Cognitive radio (CR)-enabled mesh routers facilitate opportunistic spectrum access from licensed bands and might diminish bandwidth scarcity problem in WMNs. In this work, we propose a joint link-channel selection and rate allocation algorithm (LCR) concerning to mitigate network interference and congestion to raise overall network throughput. The LCR greedily finds suitable channel allocations over forwarding links through perception based spectrum-learning method and allocate desired minimum rate (and power) over forwarding links to minimize traffic backlog. Thus, it reduces interference, allows more concurrent transmissions and boosts up overall network throughput.

abstract={In this contribution, a cognitive quality of service (QoS) mechanism is proposed for improved handoff decisions in mobile communication networks. The proposed design is a hybrid channel perception tool that trains observed key performance indicators (or channel characteristics) to discover the system's channel behavior. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework is adopted to ensure that the available channels are not completely consumed during handoffs by allocating guard channels, and using a set of regulated threshold values, the transmission and emission matrices for learning the network, were constructed. Estimates obtained from the training are then passed to a Fuzzy-based model to select the appropriate access network or base station. Simulation results prove that the proposed system is able to sustain handoffs at an average of 80%, compared to the empirical system, which average stood at 50%. Since the mobile terminal of next generation wireless networks has multiple interfaces for connection to any best connected access technology for handoff execution, two multiple attribute decision making (MADM) methods: fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and synthetic extent analysis were used to assign weights as triangular fuzzy numbers to certain criteria that influence handoff decision, and rank the alternative access networks based on weight priority scores in order to select the most optimal access network for a particular application. A future direction of this research include a prioritization of the various decision variables to improve on the overall network performance, and the provision of efficient control mechanism to deal with the integration of newer technologies deployed for optimized environments.},

Moreover, competition should also be resolved to prevent congestion and collision among secondary users who tend to access the same idle channel. In this paper, by compressing the inessential exploration phase, we first propose an asymptotically optimal, fast-converging channel selection algorithm referred to as modified-myopic strategy for the single-user scenario based on the result of multi-armed bandit. Through analysis and simulation modeling, we evaluate the performance of our approach and compare it to that of other strategies in the literature. Next we adopt a game-theoretic model and extend our algorithm to design a fair and low-complexity access strategy for multi-user case based on a generalized CSMA/CA scheme. Finally, we show the improved efficiency of the proposed approach, in particular significantly enhanced for dense networks.},

abstract={One of the reasons that Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications are not widely available is the complexity in their development. This is a consequence of the complex nature in low-level details, which a developer must manage. The vast majority of the present application developments are done using node-centric low-level languages, for example, C. In order to make the WSN technology more universal; application development complexity nature should be reduced, and development efficiency increased. This paper describes SenNet language, which is a new approach to WSN application development using a Domain-Specific Language (DSL). SenNet empowers application developers to focus on modelling the application logic using domain specific terms. The new approach gives the ability to write applications using multi-levels of abstraction (i.e. network, group, and node-level). Evaluation results show that SenNet decreases the cognitive effort required for learning WSN application development in addition to the time required to write the application by using automated code generation from abstracted language commands.},

abstract={Next-generation wireless networks are expected to support extremely high data rates and radically new applications, which require a new wireless radio technology paradigm. The challenge is that of assisting the radio in intelligent adaptive learning and decision making, so that the diverse requirements of next-generation wireless networks can be satisfied. Machine learning is one of the most promising artificial intelligence tools, conceived to support smart radio terminals. Future smart 5G mobile terminals are expected to autonomously access the most meritorious spectral bands with the aid of sophisticated spectral efficiency learning and inference, in order to control the transmission power, while relying on energy efficiency learning/inference and simultaneously adjusting the transmission protocols with the aid of quality of service learning/inference. Hence we briefly review the rudimentary concepts of machine learning and propose their employment in the compelling applications of 5G networks, including cognitive radios, massive MIMOs, femto/small cells, heterogeneous networks, smart grid, energy harvesting, device-todevice communications, and so on. Our goal is to assist the readers in refining the motivation, problem formulation, and methodology of powerful machine learning algorithms in the context of future networks in order to tap into hitherto unexplored applications and services.},

Static spectrum allocation is unable to fulfill users' demands which result in bottleneck condition. Cognitive radio provides efficient solution over bottleneck condition which arrived due to fixed spectrum assignment policy. Dynamic spectrum management is promising technique of cognitive radio to fulfill these demands. After sensing the vacant space in spectrum cognitive radio allocates vacant space spectrum to secondary users dynamically. By using the allocated spectrum cognitive radio devices provide high throughput and low latency communication. This is promising technique to overcome problem of scarcity. Considering user demands and spectrum characteristics service oriented multi attribute normalization model is formed.

abstract={For a seamless deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT), there is a need for self-organizing solutions to overcome key IoT challenges that include data processing, resource management, coexistence with existing wireless networks, and improved IoT-wide event detection. One of the most promising solutions to address these challenges is via the use of innovative learning frameworks that will enable the IoT devices to operate autonomously in a dynamic environment. However, developing learning mechanisms for the IoT requires coping with unique IoT properties in terms of resource constraints, heterogeneity, and strict quality-of-service requirements. In this paper, a number of emerging learning frameworks suitable for IoT applications are presented. In particular, the advantages, limitations, IoT applications, and key results pertaining to machine learning, sequential learning, and reinforcement learning are studied. For each type of learning, the computational complexity, required information, and learning performance are discussed. Then, to handle the heterogeneity of the IoT, a new framework based on the powerful tools of cognitive hierarchy theory is introduced. This framework is shown to efficiently capture the different IoT device types and varying levels of available resources among the IoT devices. In particular, the different resource capabilities of IoT devices are mapped to different levels of rationality in cognitive hierarchy theory, thus enabling the IoT devices to use different learning frameworks depending on their available resources. Finally, key results on the use of cognitive hierarchy theory in the IoT are presented.},

abstract={Cognitive radio sensor network (CRSN) is a novel wireless sensor network, which can effectively alleviate the scarcity of spectrum resource by equipping the cognitive technology. Usually, CRSN deploys numerous sensor nodes around the monitoring area. But the energy and storage of those nodes are both limited. Compared with the centralized CRSN, we focus more on a decentralized situation without the control center or cluster in this paper, especially on a circumstance with few information exchanges among sensor nodes. In the case of that, our goal is to help each sensor node to find an optimal strategy of channel selection in the decentralized CRSN quickly, and then, we apply a Multi-Agent Best-Response Q-Learning algorithm based on Timesharing-Tracking Framework to sequential channel selection for the first time. The algorithm not only has a low storage cost, but also can overcome the poor convergence of strategy caused by Multi-Agent simultaneous learning. For comparison, the optimal channel assignment in centralized network, the Multi-Agent Independent Q-Learning and the Win-or-Learn-Fast Policy Hill Climbing these three algorithms are taken into account, and experimental data validates that our proposed algorithm is feasible in decentralized network.},

abstract={Communication-based train control (CBTC) systems use wireless local area networks for information transmission between trains and wayside equipment. Since inevitable packet delay and drop are introduced in train-wayside communications, information uncertainties in trains' states will lead to unplanned traction/braking demands, as well as waste in electrical energy. Moreover, with the introduction of regenerative braking technology, power grids in CBTC systems are evolving to smart grids, and cost-aware power management should be employed to reduce the total financial cost of consumed electrical energy. In this paper, a cognitive control method for CBTC systems with smart grids is presented to enhance both train operation performance and cost efficiency. We formulate a cognitive control system model for CBTC systems. The information gap in cognitive control is calculated to analyze how the train-wayside communications affect the operation of trains. The Q-learning algorithm is used in the proposed cognitive control method, and a joint objective function composed of the information gap and the total financial cost is a.pplied to generate optimal policy. The medium-access control layer retry-limit adaption and traction strategy selection are adopted as cognitive actions. Extensive simulation results show that the cost efficiency and train operation performance of CBTC systems are substantially improved using our proposed cognitive control method.},

abstract={Cognitive Radio (CR) is an intelligent wireless communication system capable of sensing the environment and making decisions on how to use the available radio resource without creating any harmful interference to licensed users (Primary Users). The intelligent system module of CR provides the ability to gain the knowledge of available spectrum opportunities and reconfigure Radio Frequency (RF) operating parameters. Spectrum Sensing is a key mechanism in CR for acquiring spectrum awareness. The performance of spectrum sensing algorithm degrades due to channel impairments, such as, multipath fading, correlated shadowing and receiver uncertainty issues. To overcome this limitation, Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CSS) was introduced to take the advantage of spatial diversity of wireless receivers. In recent years, cooperative sensing based on Machine learning has been used to improve the efficiency of learning in CR. Cooperative learning can help a CR to learn the surrounding environment and improves sensing accuracy. In this paper, we propose unsupervised Archetypal Clustering approach in which the local energy vectors are decomposed into a collection of extreme points which are called Archetypes. Archetypal Clustering has similar flavor to the well-known K-means clustering, while the later provides an average view on the data, the former provides an extremal view. The performance of proposed algorithm is quantified in terms of target Probability of detection and false-alarm to meet the requirement of IEEE 802.22 Wireless Regional Area Network (WRAN) standard. Further, we compare our results with k-means clustering and Support Vector Machine (SVM).},

abstract={The wireless sensor network (WSN) is one of the key enablers for the Internet of Things (IoT), where WSNs will play an important role in future internet by several application scenarios, such as healthcare, agriculture, environment monitoring, and smart metering. However, today's radio spectrum is very crowded for the rapid increasing popularities of various wireless applications. Hence, WSN utilizing the advantages of cognitive radio technology, namely, cognitive radio-based WSN (CR-WSN), is a promising solution for spectrum scarcity problem of IoT applications. A major challenge in CR-WSN is utilizing spectrum more efficiently. Therefore, a novel channel access scheme is proposed for the problem that how to access the multiple channels with the unknown environment information for cognitive users, so as to maximize system throughput. The problem is modeled as I.I.D. multi-armed bandit model with M cognitive users and N arms (M<;N). In order to solve the competition and the fairness between cognitive users of WSNs, a fair channel-grouping scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme divides these channels into M groups according to the water-filling principle based on the learning algorithm UCB-K index, the number of channels not less than one in each group and then allocate channel group for each cognitive user by using distributed learning algorithm fairly. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme cannot only effectively solve the problem of collision between the cognitive users, improve the utilization rate of the idle spectrum, and at the same time reflect the fairness of selecting channels between cognitive users.},

abstract={Nowadays, cognitive small cell networks (CSCNs) have been widely accepted as a promising and efficient method to deal with exponentially increasing demand of wireless data services. As small cells become smaller and denser, inter-cell interference (ICI) at user equipments (UEs), coming from adjacent base stations (BSs), expanded dramatically and has grown more complicated to be managed. In order to improve cellular throughput in randomly changing small cell networks (SCNs), this article investigates the problem of joint channel and power allocation with dynamic active BSs, using dynamic stochastic game-theoretic learning solutions. It is challenging to address this optimization problem especially when active BSs sets are randomly changing from slot to slot. Dynamic asymmetric graphical game for network throughput maximization will be proposed in this article. It is proved to be an exact potential game (EPG) and the best Nash equilibria of this game correspond to the optimal solutions of this optimization problem. To cope with the difficulties of uncertainty and dynamicity in SCNs, a dynamic joint channel and power selection stochastic learning algorithm (DJCPS-SLA) is put forward, which is analytically proved converging to the Nash equilibria of the accurately formulated game upon changing active BSs sets. The performance of the proposed learning algorithm, DJCPSSLA, far surpasses that of random selection algorithm for joint channel and power allocation. Moreover, the dynamics promote the network throughput to some extent. Finally, the simulation results validate the convergence, annotates a tradeoff between dynamicity, optimality, and robustness.},

abstract={Consider the diversity of users' traffic types, we investigate the problem of distributed carrier aggregation in cognitive small cell networks. In most existing carrier aggregation (CA) researches, they aimed to optimize the throughput or to mitigate the interference. However, in practical wireless communication users' quality of experience (QoE) is the ultimate concerning. Different QoE functions for different traffic types, which consider not only the throughput demand of users but also the distinct cost of different CA types, are defined in this paper. These QoE functions consider not only the throughput demand of users but also the distinct cost of different CA types. The problem of spectrum allocation for CA is formulated as a QoE-aware game model. The utility function is designed considering the current user's QoE and the QoE of the neighbor ones jointly. It is proved to be an exact potential game. Based on stochastic learning automata (SLA), we propose a multiple players carrier aggregation learning algorithm. It is proved to converge towards Nash equilibrium (NE) of the game. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed game-theoretic CA approach.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) employ Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) spectrum bands for communication, which are overloaded due to various technologies such as WLANs and other WSNs. Therefore, such networks must employ intelligent methods such as Cognitive Radio (CR) to coexist with other networks. This study investigates the use of supervised Machine Learning (ML) for channel selection in WSNs. The proposed models were analyzed using ML tools and techniques, and the best algorithms were evaluated on real sensor nodes. The experiments show performance improvements on the delivery rate and delivery delay when the proposed cognitive solutions are employed.},

abstract={The introduction of heterogeneous wireless mesh technologies provides an opportunity for higher network capacity, wider coverage, and higher quality of service (QoS). Each wireless device utilizes different standards, data formats, protocols, and access technologies. However, the diversity and complexity of such technologies create challenges for traditional control and management systems. This paper proposes a heterogeneous metropolitan area network architecture that combines an IEEE 802.11 wireless mesh network (WMN) with a long-term evolution (LTE) network. In addition, a new heterogeneous routing protocol and a routing algorithm based on reinforcement learning called cognitive heterogeneous routing are proposed to select the appropriate transmission technology based on parameters from each network. The proposed heterogeneous network overcomes the problems of sending packets over long paths, island nodes, and interference in WMNs and increases the overall capacity of the combined network by utilizing unlicensed frequency bands instead of buying more license frequency bands for LTE. The work is validated through extensive simulations that indicate that the proposed heterogeneous WMN outperforms the LTE and Wi-Fi networks when used individually. The simulation results show that the proposed network achieves an increase of up to 200% in throughput compared with Wi-Fi-only networks or LTE-only networks.},

volume={15},

pages={1703-1715}, 
abstract={Sniffer channel assignment (SCA) is a fundamental building block for wireless data capture, which is essential for traffic monitoring and network forensics. Most of the existing SCA approaches for cognitive radio networks (CRNs) adopt optimization-based methods and rely on the prior knowledge of the secondary user (SU) activities. To relax this constraint, learning-based methods have been recently developed; however, there is still insufficient theoretical understanding within the learning framework for SCA. In this paper, we aim to maximize the total amount of the captured SU traffic, and we formulate the SCA problem as a nonstochastic/adversarial multiarmed bandit problem. Moreover, the inherent error in wireless capturing, i.e., imperfect monitoring, is considered in our model. We propose two online learning algorithms for the SCA scenarios with and without channel switching costs, respectively, and their regret performances are proved uniformly sublinear in time and polynomial in the number of channels. The numerical evaluation shows, in addition to their robust regret performances, the proposed algorithms greatly outperform the existing SCA approaches in the amount of effectively captured SU traffic.},

abstract={Reviews the book, "Cognitive Radio: Interoperability Through Waveform Reconfiguration (Lechowicz, L. and Kokar, M.; 2016). The proliferation of mobile and wireless devices and the complementary increase in their bandwidth demands are presenting real challenges to pushthe envelope of wireless communications. This has resulted in the building of new wireless technologies, such as software-defined radios (SDRs), cognitive radios (CRs), and MIMO antennas. There have also been accompanying improvements in software methods, such as network virtualization and protocol design to leverage multiple wireless interfaces simultaneously. CRs, SDRs, or CR+SDR are being explored in the research domain presently to meet the needs for higher spectrum bandwidth and wireless reliability. CRs are specifically designed to be aware of the radio environment in their vicinity and choose a frequency and bandwidth for communication that is allocated to a primary user (e.g., TV station), but is not in use at the moment. In that sense, CRs cannot only help improve wireless bandwidth utilization, but also help meet applications’ bandwidth demands with more success. The big challenge in CR communication is for the two communicating radios to talk to each other. In many cases, the two radios cannot communicate despite being unobstructed on account of them not having a set of common waveforms (QPSK, BPSK, etc.) to communicate with. This sometimes requires the radios to negotiate and one radio to inform the other radio device how to recreate the waveform to enable communication. This is termed dynamic auto configuration or interoperability. Often, such interoperability requires the creation of an ontology for describing the different parameters needed for efficient negotiation and also to perform accurate negotiation to learn the waveform. This book discusses the concepts that are needed for understanding and realizing a cognitive radio that implements dynamic interoperability via- waveform reconfiguration. The book is organized into nine chapters with each chapter ending in useful references. This book provides a multi-faceted view of the CR and SDR domains and their overlap. It is a good book for beginners and also a decent reference book for practitioners.},

abstract={Cognitive radio attracts researchers' attention recently in radio resource management due to its ability to exploit environment awareness in configuring radio system parameters. Cognitive engine (CE) is the structure known for deciding system parameters' adaptation using optimization and machine learning techniques. However, these techniques have strengths and weaknesses depending on the experienced network scenario that make one more appropriate than others. In this paper, we propose a novel design for the cognitive system called supervised cognitive system (SCS), which aims to perform radio parameters adaptation with the most appropriate CE learning technique for the encountered network scenario. To realize SCS, it is required to evaluate the performance of different CEs in different network scenarios and according to certain performance objectives. In addition, the ability to select the most appropriate CE learning technique for adaptation in the current network scenario is also a priority in our design. Therefore, SCS investigates the relationship between learning and performance improvement and it employs online learning to classify scenarios and select the most appropriate CE learning technique. The testbed implementation and evaluation results in terms of goodput, packet error rate, and spectral efficiency show that the proposed SCS achieves more than 50% in performance gain compared to the best standalone CE.},

pages={1-1}, 
abstract={In this paper we show that inter-technology interference can be recognized using commodity WiFi devices by monitoring the statistics of receiver errors. Indeed, while for WiFi standard frames the error probability varies during the frame reception in different frame fields (PHY, MAC headers, payloads) protected with heterogeneous coding, errors may appear randomly at any point during the time the demodulator is trying to receive an exogenous interfering signal. We thus detect and identify cross-technology interference on off-the-shelf WiFi cards by monitoring the sequence of receiver errors (bad PLCP, bad FCS, invalid headers, etc.) and propose two methods to recognize the source of interference based on Artificial Neural Networks and hidden Markov chains. The result is quite impressive, reaching an average accuracy of over 95% in recognizing ZigBee, Microwave and LTE (in unlicensed spectrum) interference.},

abstract={The advent of the Internet-of-Things has introduced a new paradigm that supports a decentralized and hierarchical communication architecture, where a great deal of analytics processing occurs at the edge and at the end-devices instead of in the Cloud. To map the embedded-systems requirements, we present a holistic research approach to the development of low-power architectures inspired by the human brain, where process development and integration, circuit design, system architecture, and learning algorithms are simultaneously optimized. This paper is organized as follows: We begin with a survey of recent research on the human brain and a historical perspective of cognitive neuroscience. Then, artificial intelligence is introduced, and the challenges of Deep Learning systems (in terms of power requirements) are addressed. The key reasons to distribute intelligence over the whole network are discussed. To emphasize the need for low-power solutions, a quantitative benchmark of existing specialized edge platforms that can execute machine-learning algorithms on conventional embedded hardware is presented. The primary focus of this paper will be on the implementation of optimized neuromorphic hardware as a highly promising solution for future ultra-low-power cognitive systems. We show that emerging technologies (such as advanced CMOS, 3D technologies, emerging resistive memories, and Silicon photonics), coupled with novel brain-inspired paradigms, such as spike-coding and spike-time-dependent-plasticity, have extraordinary potential to provide intelligent features in hardware, approaching the way knowledge is created and processed in the human brain. Finally, we conclude with our vision of the enabled future disruptive applications and a discussion of the main challenges which should be tackled to exploit the full potential of brain-inspired technologies.},

abstract={The identification of Radio Access Technology (RAT) of Primary User (PU) by Secondly User (SU) is important to avoid interference for spectrum sharing techniques using Cognitive Radio (CR). RATs have become more diversified with the introduction of various kinds of services using wireless communication. Therefore, it is desirable that a RAT identification system, which can easily cope with the diversification of RATs, is applied to cognitive radio. The purpose of this study is to identify multiple RATs in the same frequency band by using online learning. In order to improve the identification accuracy of RATs with similar features, we proposed a normalization method for radio features extracted from the signal's spectrogram. We evaluated the RAT classifier created using the proposed method by calculating the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and the identification accuracy. The results of the ROC curve revealed that the proposed method is effective for some supervised learning. Moreover, the results of the identification accuracy revealed that it could improve the identification accuracy for multiple RATs on the same frequency by nearly 40%.},

abstract={Recently, there has been increasing interest of deploying computation-intensive and rich-media applications on mobile devices, and ultra-low latency has become an important requirement to achieve high user QoE. However, conventional mobile communication systems are incapable of providing considerable communication and computation resources to support low latency. Although 5G is expected to effectively increase communication capacity, it is difficult to achieve ultra-low end-to-end delay for the ever growing number of cognitive applications. To address this issue, this article first proposes a novel network architecture using a resource cognitive engine and data engine. The resource cognitive intelligence, based on the learning of network contexts, is aimed at a global view of computing, caching, and communication resources in the network. The data cognitive intelligence, based on data analytics, is critical for the provisioning of personalized and smart services toward specific domains. Then we introduce an optimal caching strategy for the small-cell cloud and the macro-cell cloud. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed caching strategy, and its latency is lower than that of the two conventional approaches, that is, the popular caching strategy and the greedy caching strategy.},

abstract={We consider a dynamic multichannel access problem, where multiple correlated channels follow an unknown joint Markov model and users select the channel to transmit data. The objective is to find a policy that maximizes the expected long-term number of successful transmissions. The problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) with unknown system dynamics. To overcome the challenges of unknown dynamics and prohibitive computation, we apply the concept of reinforcement learning and implement a Deep Q-Network (DQN). We first study the optimal policy for fixed-pattern channel switching with known system dynamics and show through simulations that DQN can achieve the same optimal performance without knowing the system statistics. We then compare the performance of DQN with a Myopic policy and a Whittle Index-based heuristic through both more general simulations as well as real data trace and show that DQN achieves near-optimal performance in more complex situations. Finally, we propose an adaptive DQN approach with the capability to adapt its learning in time-varying scenarios.},

abstract={The future channel state is predicted based on the historical state of the channel, which partly solves the problem of robustness and reliability in spectrum sensing. Precise spectrum prediction is an effective way to conserve perceived energy and time and can increase the throughput of cognitive radio systems. In order to improve the accuracy of the spectral state prediction of cognitive radio systems, the feasibility of spectrum prediction using fuzzy wavelet neural network (FWNN) is studied and verified. Firstly, The use of wavelet to generate fuzzy rules of the system, the gradient algorithm is used to learn the parameters of the fuzzy system. Secondly, the time series is predicted by fuzzy wavelet neural network. Lastly, in the prediction of cognitive radio spectral states, simulation results show that the FWNN algorithm can get better predictive accuracy than other algorithm, and the throughput of secondary user increased by 15.3% than the general spectral prediction algorithm. The improvement of prediction accuracy will promote the application of spectrum prediction in cognitive radio networks, and helpful to solve the problem in robustness and reliability of spectrum sensing.},

The RBFs are represented as centroids at optimized locations, using machine learning to jointly optimize their positions, weights and Gaussian decaying parameters. Optimization is performed using expectation maximization with a least squares loss function and a quadratic regularizer.

abstract={In this paper, we study distributed power allocation for multi-flow carrier aggregation (MFCA) in cognitive cellular networks. Our approach differs from the conventional water filling (WF) algorithm since we deal with the heterogeneous fading channels, wherein all of the Lagrange multipliers are not handled equally over the heterogeneous cells. The distributed power control solution is carried out over the heterogeneous fading channels that are considered non-identically distributed and non-identical Nakagami- $m$ fading channels. We first formulate the optimization problem and we next solve it using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which allows the required decomposition for each channel and required statistical learning among the different sub-problem solutions.We also provide comparison with dual decomposition method (DDM) and WF solutions considered as solutions without cognition. Simulation results highlight the performance gain of ADMM in terms of number of iterations. Further, we provide a multiuser application scenario, where the analysis on the new fading channel model for Nakagami- $m$ channels is carried out. We distinguish into the synchronous and the asynchronous ADMM implementations tackling with the asynchronous user updates that can be found in an heterogeneous network deployment. The simulation results are obtained to highlight the impact of the partial barrier and the bounded delay in the asynchronous use case.},

abstract={We consider the problem of dynamic spectrum access for network utility maximization in multichannel wireless networks. The shared bandwidth is divided into K orthogonal channels, and the users access the spectrum using a random access protocol. In the beginning of each time slot, each user selects a channel and transmits a packet with a certain attempt probability. After each time slot, each user that has transmitted a packet receives a local observation indicating whether its packet was successfully delivered or not (i.e., ACK signal). The objective is to find a multi-user strategy that maximizes a certain network utility in a distributed manner without online coordination or message exchanges between users. Obtaining an optimal solution for the spectrum access problem is computationally expensive in general due to the large state space and partial observability of the states. To tackle this problem, we develop a distributed dynamic spectrum access algorithm based on deep multi-user reinforcement leaning. Specifically, at each time slot, each user maps its current state to spectrum access actions based on a trained deep-Q network used to maximize the objective function. Experimental results have demonstrated that users are capable to learn good policies that achieve strong performance in this challenging partially observable setting only from their ACK signals, without online coordination, message exchanges between users, or carrier sensing.},

abstract={Channel handoff is a crucial function for Cognitive radio ad hoc networks (CRAHNs). The absence of centralized infrastructures and the limited power make the handoff design more challenging. A learning-based interference-aware handoff scheme is proposed for distributed CRAHNs. We model the channel handoff process as a Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and adopt a Q-learning algorithm to find an optimal handoff strategy in a long term. The proposed algorithm obtains an efficient transmission performance by considering the interferences among SUs and PUs. To achieve PU awareness, the handoff scheme predicts the PU activities by using the historical channel usage statistics. In addition, we also propose a refined channel selection rule to compromise between learning speed and cumulative transmission reward. The simulation results show that the proposed handoff scheme can adapt to the PU activities and achieves a better performance in terms of high throughput and low collisions. And the learning process keeps a considerable balance between convergence time and cumulative reward.},

abstract={In the software defined networking (SDN)-based wireless mesh network (WMN) architecture (SD-WMN), the network is monitored and managed in a centralized manner. Although the use of SDN simplifies the WMN management, it is still not clear whether the SDN architecture, which was originally designed for wired links, can effectively handle the dynamic topology of WMNs. This paper addresses the traffic balancing issue introduced by node mobility. To reduce the response time of SDN controller for dynamic network topology, a two-layer supervised learning model is proposed that helps the controller to predict the node mobility and link failure probability. Then, an alternative route selection scheme is proposed, which achieves optimal traffic balancing while minimizing the control plane overhead. Efficiency of the proposed SD-WMN architecture is validated in the widely used network simulator -ns-3. Our results demonstrate the network throughput enhancement achieved by the proposed SD-WMN architecture with link-failure adaptive traffic control.},

abstract={Secure and stable routing is a critical issue in a conventional network environment, as the control and data planes are integrated. An intelligent routing is highly essential to provide an attack free network to its intended users. The programmable software defined network is an emerging network paradigm in which the security policies and the forwarding rules are implemented in the controller via North Bound Interface. This study incorporates a cognitive neural network learning algorithm namely restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), to detect the routing-based distributed denial of service attacks in dynamic source routing (DSR) protocol. RBM is a stochastic and unsupervised learning algorithm that self-learns the network conditions by using its reasoning capability and segregates malicious routes in the route cache using context-aware trust metrics such as reputation and energy consumption implemented in North Bound Application Programming Interface. The results show that a cognitive DSR protocol provides secure routing by increased packet delivery ratio, decreased end-to-end delay, reduced energy consumption and accurate detection of malicious routes compared with the conventional DSR protocol.},

abstract={By growing the demand for location based services in indoor environments in recent years, fingerprint based indoor localization has attracted much research interest. The fingerprint localization method works based on received signal strength (RSS) in wireless sensor networks. This method uses RSS measurements from available transmitter sensors, which are collected by a smart phone with internal sensors. In this article, we propose a novel algorithm that takes advantage of deep learning, extreme learning machines, and high level extracted features by autoencoder to improve the localization performance in the feature extraction and the classification. Furthermore, as the fingerprint database needs to be updated (due to the dynamic nature of environment), we also increase the number of training data, in order to improve the localization performance, gradually. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method provides a significant improvement in localization performance by using high level extracted features by autoencoder and increasing the number of training data.},

abstract={In this paper, a sequential probing method for interference constraint learning is proposed to allow a centralized cognitive radio network (CRN) accessing the frequency band of a primary user (PU) in an underlay cognitive scenario with a designed PU protection specification. The main idea is that the CRN probes the PU, and subsequently, eavesdrops the reverse PU link to acquire the binary ACK/NACK packet. This feedback indicates whether the probing-induced interference is harmful or not and can be used to learn the PU interference constraint. The cognitive part of this sequential probing process is the selection of the power levels of the secondary users that aims to learn the PU interference constraint with a minimum number of probing attempts while setting a limit on the number of harmful probing-induced interference events or equivalently of NACK packet observations over a time window. This constrained design problem is studied within the active learning (AL) framework and an optimal solution is derived and implemented with a sophisticated, accurate, and fast Bayesian learning method, the expectation propagation. The performance of this solution is also demonstrated through numerical simulations and compared with modified versions of AL techniques we developed in earlier work.},

abstract={Modulation recognition algorithms have recently received a great deal of attention in academia and industry. In addition to their application in the military field, these algorithms found civilian use in reconfigurable systems, such as cognitive radios. Most previously existing algorithms are focused on recognition of a single modulation. However, a multiple-input multiple-output two-way relaying channel (MIMO TWRC) with physical-layer network coding (PLNC) requires the recognition of the pair of sources modulations from the superposed constellation at the relay. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for recognition of sources modulations for MIMO TWRC with PLNC. The proposed algorithm is divided in two steps. The first step uses the higher order statistics based features in conjunction with genetic algorithm as a features selection method, while the second step employs AdaBoost as a classifier. Simulation results show the ability of the proposed algorithm to provide a good recognition performance at acceptable signal-to-noise values.},

abstract={In cognitive radio systems, fast and efficient spectrum selection is a vital task to minimize the overhead of spectrum scanning, and hence to improve the response time of the system. So, the choice of channel sensing sequence plays an important role for better performance of the system. This paper proposes a co-operative Q-learning based spectrum sensing technique for the secondary users of an ad hoc network to access the primary channels. By the proposed technique, every secondary user (SU) maintains a dynamic priority list of channels based on Q-learning from its own action-observation history, as well as from spatial channel information exchange among its local neighbors. Whenever there is a demand an SU scans the spectrum according to the order in the priority list until there is a success. Simulation studies show that with significantly less computing and scanning overhead, our proposed Q-learning based approach improves the response time and call block/drop rate to offer better performance compared to other contemporary reinforcement learning based approaches.},

Further, in the domain of internet, data is not geo-centric any longer and multiple locations are contributing to the data acquisition technologies including but not limited to packet captures, data logs, routing and switching technologies and security detection and prevention systems. It can be stated that internet data is highly sparse with high dimensionality and an event can be represented by correlation of multiple attributes of a data set. Notwithstanding, analysis of such data set takes enormous human efforts and time. Machine learning has been found as promising candidate to extract information of interest from the data set but human cognitive analysis is required to feed to learning algorithms which is also called data preprocessing stage. This analysis requires cognitive domain knowledge, experiential learning and complexity analysis and therefore, traditional models fail in selecting proper attributes due to nonexistence of cognitive aspects. In this work, authors have proposed a fractal based cognitive model for artificial neural network to extract important attributes from two different internet data sets.},

abstract={The increasing demand on the limited spectrum of unlicensed 2.4 GHz ISM band leads to the coexistence problems, which are one of the major challenges especially for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The coexistence issue does not only affect the service quality, but also shorten the battery lifetime of the WSN devices. Most works focus on system internal processes without the concern on environmental effects such as interference. This work proposes an intelligent channel assignment with transmit power optimization for Cognitive Wireless Sensor Networks (CWSNs). The adaptation includes dynamic channel assignment to avoid interference and power level adjustment in order to maintain the service quality as well as optimize energy usage. A simulation model has been developed to test the system performance of our proposed method along with the validation results from an analytical model. A test bed has been setup to observe the system performance in terms of power consumption and throughput. Results show that systems integrated with our proposed method have better performances as well as improve energy usage efficiency in comparison with the traditional IEEE 802.15.4 based WSN.},

abstract={Millimeter wave (mmW) technologies are currently being proposed as backhaul for outdoor urban small cells. However, non-line-of-sight (NLOS) operation must be addressed before solutions can be fully realised. This letter proposes a reinforcement learning algorithm for improving the reliability of an mmW NLOS small cell backhaul system based on propagation by diffraction. Simulation results show that the algorithm achieves the desired data rate and can detect malfunctioning on a path within a predetermined time, and make a decision to switch to an alternative path, adjust transmission power, or change the operating mode in order to improve system performance.},

pages={703-718}, 
abstract={The ever-increasing demand for seamless high-definition video streaming, along with the widespread adoption of the dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) standard, has been a major driver of the large amount of research on bitrate adaptation algorithms. The complexity and variability of the video content and of the mobile wireless channel make this an ideal application for learning approaches. Here, we present D-DASH, a framework that combines deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques to optimize the quality of experience (QoE) of DASH. Different learning architectures are proposed and assessed, combining feed-forward and recurrent deep neural networks with advanced strategies. D-DASH designs are thoroughly evaluated against prominent algorithms from the state-of-the-art, both heuristic and learning-based, evaluating performance indicators such as image quality across video segments and freezing/rebuffering events. Our numerical results are obtained on real and simulated channel traces and show the superiority of D-DASH in nearly all the considered quality metrics. Besides yielding a considerably higher QoE, the D-DASH framework exhibits faster convergence to the rate-selection strategy than the other learning algorithms considered in the study. This makes it possible to shorten the training phase, making D-DASH a good candidate for client-side runtime learning.},

pages={818-821}, 
abstract={This letter investigates the anti-jamming problem with discrete power strategies, and then a Stackelberg game is formulated to model the competitive interactions between the user and jammer. Specifically, the user acts as the leader, whereas the jammer is the follower. Based on their own utilities, the user and jammer select their power strategies and determine their respective optimal strategies. Also, a hierarchical power control algorithm (HPCA) is proposed to obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium, and the asymptotic convergence is analyzed. In addition, we consider the impact of the imperfect information due to the jammer's bounded rationality and inaccurate observation of the user's action. Finally, simulations are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed HPCA algorithm, and simulation results demonstrate that the jammer's bounded rationality and limited observation lead to the increase of the user's utility.},

abstract={In this paper, we describe the original problem statement and the two winning solutions to the IEEE DySPAN Challenge, organized in Baltimore in 2017. The idea of the challenge was to invite teams to propose as diverse as possible solutions to a well defined problem, and evaluate the performance of the proposed solutions in a realistic environment. The challenge is defined to enable benchmarking and comparison of multiple teams, possibly working on different parts of the system, in a real environment. The winning solutions represented a complete and working system, working robustly and adapting to both anticipated scenario changes, as well as random effects caused by the conference setting. The code for running the challenge along with the winning solutions is publicly available, so that interested teams can start from the code when designing or benchmarking solutions, as well as when setting up own challenges and competitions. As a result, the challenge can serve as a milestone toward the creation of a benchmarking series. This paper contains all the necessary details about the software repositories so that it becomes possible to rerun the challenge and start building novel solutions based on the winners in IEEE DySPAN 2017.},

pages={146-151}, 
abstract={The CRN is a future generation wireless communication system that allows SUs to use the underutilized or unused spectrum, known as white spaces, in licensed spectrum with minimum interference to PUs. However, the dynamic conditions of CRNs (e.g., PUs' activities and channel availability) make routing more challenging compared to traditional wireless networks. In this tutorial, we focus on solving the routing problem in CRNs with the help of a clustering mechanism. Cluster-based routing in CRNs enhances network scalability by reducing the flooding of routing overheads, as well as network stability by reducing the effects of dynamicity of channel availability. Additionally, RL, an artificial intelligence approach, is applied as a tool to further enhance network performance. We present SMART, which is a cluster-based routing scheme designed for the CRN, and evaluate its performance via simulations in order to show the effectiveness of cluster- based routing in CRNs using RL.},

abstract={We evaluate the accuracy of a machine-learning-based path loss model trained on 42157324 RSSI samples collected over one year from an environmental wireless-sensor network using 2.4 GHz radios. The 2218 links in the network span a 2000 km2 basin and are deployed in a complex environment, with large variations of terrain attributes and vegetation coverage. Four candidate machine-learning algorithms were evaluated in order to find the one with lowest error: 1) Random Forest; 2) AdaBoost; 3) Neural Networks; and 4) K-Nearest-Neighbors. Of the candidate models, Random Forest showed the lowest error. The independent variables used in the model include path distance, canopy coverage, terrain variability, and path angle. We compare the accuracy of this model to several well-known canonical (free space, plane earth) and empirical propagation models (Weissberger, ITU-R, COST235). Unlike canonical models, machine-learning algorithms are not problem-specific: they rely on an extensive dataset and a flexible model architecture to make predictions. We show how this model achieves a 37% reduction in the average prediction error compared to the canonical/empirical model with the best performance. This paper presents an in-depth discussion on the strengths and limitations of the proposed approach as well as opportunities for further research.},

abstract={Wireless communication plays a vital role in the operations of modern rail transportation. The characteristics of rapid train motion make the wireless spectrum environment unstable, discontinuous, and unpredictable. These uncertainties, coupled with inherent spectrum scarcity, result in inefficiencies in wireless communication. Applying cognitive radio in railway wireless communication systems is a cutting-edge research field. Most rail cognitive radio studies focus only on solving spectrum scarcity. The authors' improved rail cognitive radio model uses a Bayesian network with numerous channel contextual features to probabilistically infer the likelihood of spectrum accessibility. This scheme provides a completely new way to solve the problem of low spectral efficiency of cognitive radio in rail transit.},

abstract={Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) for Math still use traditional methods of input, such as computer keyboard and mouse. This strategy exposes students to a high extraneous cognitive load, due to the way the students are used to work, what could impair their learning. This paper presents a tool for Math ITSs that uses the student handwriting as data input. This tool was integrated into PAT2Math, an algebraic ITS, for an experimental evaluation in a public school with 48 students. It followed a design of control and experimental groups with pre and post-tests and a post questionnaire. Although our results have shown statistically significant improvement in student learning gains in both groups, no difference between groups was found. However, questionnaire responses suggest that handwriting provides a greater facility to the insertion of equations into ITSs for Math if compared with traditional methods (i.e., keyboard and mouse).},

abstract={Recent advancements related to device to device (D2D) communication make it possible for a transmitting node to dynamically select the interface to be used for data transfers locally, without traversing any network infrastructure. In this scenario, a controller is identified, whose goal is to manage the D2D connection after its establishment. The software defined networking paradigm makes it possible to select this controller node via software: a device becomes the master node of a Wi-Fi-direct network, whereas the remaining units, i.e., the clients, can exchange data with other devices through the master. This paper develops a machine learning-based prediction algorithm for the aforementioned scenario, in which multiple elements, while receiving data from the controller, require an accurate on-the-fly estimation of the remaining transmission time, i.e., the estimated time of arrival. Different machine learning approaches are considered for this task, with the goal of exploiting only the information available at each client, without modifying any standard communication protocol. This information is critical when, for instance, a mobile user needs to decide whether or not to delay a data transfer, based on the load of the network and on the residual time under radio coverage from an access point.},

abstract={We investigate the global throughput maximization of distributed spectrum reusing (DSR) in cognitive radio (CR) network, which reaches the two-dimensional spectrum multiplexing.

In this paper, we propose a new temporal-spatial spectrum reusing scheme by fully exploiting the location information of devices, where multiple users can access one channel simultaneously. In distributed applications, the global information will be unavailable, and therefore a non-cooperative game is formulated. It is proved as an exact potential game (EPG), which has at least one pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE). Then, an improved decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is developed to achieve the NE points. The network performance is evaluated by computer simulations.},

abstract={Cognitive radio (CR) is an enabling technology for future wireless spectrum allocation to improve the use of licensed spectrum by enabling unlicensed users equipped with CRs to coexist with incumbent users in licensed spectrum bands while causing no interference to incumbent communication. However, security challenges faced by CR technology are still a research topic. One of the prevailing challenges, is the radio frequency jamming attack , where adversaries are able to exploit on-the-fly reconfigurability potentials and learning mechanism of cognitive radios in order to devise and deploy advanced jamming tactics. These attacks can significantly impact the performance of wireless communication systems and lead to significant overheads in terms of retransmission and increment of power consumption. In this work, a new jammer detection algorithm is proposed for wide-band (WB) radios. The proposed approach assumes a WB spectrum occupied by various narrow-band (NB) signals, which can be either legitimate or jamming signals. First, the received WB signal is recovered from sub-Nyquist rate samples using compressed sensing. Compressed sensing is used to alleviate Nyquist rate sampling requirements at the receiver A/D converter. After the Nyquist rate signal has been recoverd, a cyclostationary spectral analysis is performed on this estimated WB signal to compute spectral correlation function (SCF). The alpha profile is then extracted from SCF and used to classify each NB signal as a licit signal or illicit signal. In the end, the performance of the algorithm is shown with the help of Monte-Carlo simulations under different empirical setups.},

abstract={Self organized networks has been one of the first concrete implementations of autonomic network management concept. Currently, several Self-Organizing-Network (SON) functions are developed by Radio Access Network (RAN) vendors and already deployed in many networks all around the world. These functions have been designed independently to replace different operational tasks. The concern of making these functions work together in a coherent manner has been studied later in particular in SEMAFOUR project where a Policy Based SON Management (PBSM) framework has been proposed to holistically manage a SON enabled network, namely a network with several individual SON functions. Enriching this PBSM framework with cognition capability is the next step towards the realization of the initial promise of SON concept: a unique self-managed network that responds autonomously and efficiently to the operator high level requirements and objectives. This paper proposes a cognitive PBSM system that enhances the SON management decisions by learning from past experience using Q-learning approach. Our approach is evaluated by simulation on a SON enabled Long-Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) network with several SON functions. The paper shows that the decisions are enhanced during the learning process and discusses the implementation options of this solution.},

abstract={Reliability, interoperability and efficiency are fundamental in Wireless Sensor Network deployment. Herein we look at how transmission power control may be used to reduce interference, which is particularly problematic in high-density conditions. We adopt a distributed approach where every node has the ability to learn which transmission power is most appropriate, given the network conditions and quality of service targets. The status of the network is represented by the combination of three parameters: number of retransmissions, clear channel assessment attempts and the quantized average latency. The target is to maintain packet loss at the lowest possible level, whilst striving for minimum transmission power. The learning phase is managed by an ε-greedy strategy, which directs the physical layer of each node to choose between either a random action (exploration) or the best action (exploitation). We demonstrate as our learning sensors automatically discover the best trade off between power and quality.},

abstract={Cooperative sensing enables secondary users to combine individual sensing results in order to attain sensing accuracies beyond those achieved by consumer RF devices. However, due to sensing costs, secondary users may prefer not to cooperate to the sensing task, leading to higher false alarm probability. In this paper, we study how information about the presence of cooperators affects the dynamics of cooperative sensing schemes. We consider two scenarios, namely the case when SUs cannot detect the presence of other potential cooperators, and the case when SUs have prior information on the presence of other SUs in radio range. Using an evolutionary game framework, we demonstrate that protocols delivering such type of information to SUs reduce cooperation and ultimately lead to degraded network performance. Finally, a learning process based on the replicator dynamics is proposed which is capable to drive the system to the evolutionary stable solution. The results of the paper are illustrated through numerical simulations.},

We consider two different classes of services at the SU, i.e., delay sensitive (DS) and best effort (BE) services, and assign a higher priority to the DS services. We apply priority queuing model to address this priority issue in the CRN. Based on the queuing model, two Markov decision processes (MDPs) are formulated with objectives to minimize the average delay of both services while guaranteeing the priority of the DS services. Reinforcement learning is applied to find the optimal solutions when the traffic and channel characteristics are unknown. To address the computational complexity issue in the MDP solutions, we propose a myopic method based on the estimated packet sojourn time, which is derived by formulating a phase type distribution. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of all proposed algorithms for load-balancing spectrum decision. It also shows that the proposed myopic scheme can achieve significant reduction on computational complexity with a cost on the delay performance of low priority BE services.},

abstract={The cognitive radio network is intelligent in adapting to the dynamic network environment, and it also provides a new way to solve the application limitation of nowadays MAC protocols. In this paper, an adaptive MAC protocol selection scheme based on machine learning is proposed for cognitive radio networks. This scheme can combine the respective advantages of the competitive protocols and non-competitive protocols according to the network loads, and help the network nodes to select the MAC protocol that best suits the current network circumstance. Simulation results validate our proposal that it always select the appropriate MAC protocol that best suits the network circumstance. It is also proven that, the accuracy of the proposed MAC protocol selection strategy far surpasses that of existing work.},

abstract={In this paper, we discuss a novel intelligent channel sensing based secure cross layer cognitive networking architecture for resilient space communication. A cognitive network can accurately, autonomously, intelligently, and rapidly adapt to a continuously/dynamically changing communication environment. We propose to develop a new cognitive networking architecture in the context of space communication for various NASA applications such as SCaN (space communication and navigation) system. Specifically, an intelligent channel sensing engine will sense space communication channel information and interferences including signal and interference detection, RF parameter estimation, signal identification via advanced signal processing techniques such as cyclostationary analysis. Next, artificial intelligence techniques such as neural network and support vector machine are exploited to learn and predict the channel dynamics from past channel sensing data. Such characterization enables optimizing waveforms through combinations of coding, encryption, and modulation before the short communication window becomes available, thereby saving valuable resources (e.g. time). Furthermore, a cross-layer cognitive networking algorithm will be developed to dynamically select and reconfigure network protocols at several layers in varying degrees. Finally, algorithms, instrumentation, methods, and software being used by the cognitive network in decision-making will be protected via intelligent malicious behavior detection/prevention and secure hardware where applicable.},

Different problems which are accrued in CR-MANET network are described. Two of them, spectrum sensing and channel assigning are the main area of the research. Spectrum sensing is oriented on the frequency gaps finding when Wi-Fi, as a wireless technology was used. Mobile devices used some intelligent and non-intelligent techniques for selection and assigning possible channels between them. In the paper is presented one intelligent method, fuzzy logic, which tries to solve a problem with effective channel assigning. Results from spectrum sensing are the main inputs arguments for the fuzzy logic process, which gives the recommendation of channels assigning for every mobile node. This introduced problem was simulated and compared to the set of nodes in CR-MANET network. Non-intelligent and intelligent methods of channel assigning were used and compare their effectivity.},

pages={1-1}, 
abstract={In this paper, we consider the potential of data-transmission in a system with a massive number of radiating and sensing elements, thought of as a contiguous surface of electromagnetically active material. We refer to this as a Large Intelligent Surface (LIS). The "LIS" is a newly proposed concept, which conceptually goes beyond contemporary massive MIMO technology, and arises from our vision of a future where man-made structures are electronically active with integrated electronics and wireless communication making the entire environment "intelligent". Firstly, we consider capacities of single-antenna autonomous terminals communicating to the LIS where the entire surface is used as a receiving antenna-array in a perfect line-of-sight (LOS) propagation environment. Under the condition that the surface-area is sufficiently large, the received signal after a matched-filtering (MF) operation can be closely approximated by a sinc-function-like intersymbol interference (ISI) channel. Secondly, we analyze a normalized capacity measured per unit-surface, for a fixed transmit power per volume-unit with different terminal-deployments. As terminal-density increases, the limit of the normalized capacity [nats/s/Hz/volume-unit] achieved when wavelength $lambda$ approaches zero is equal to half of the transmit power per volume-unit divided by noise spatial power spectral density (PSD). Thirdly, we show that the number of independent signal dimensions that can be harvested per meter deployed surface is $2/lambda$ for one-dimensional terminal-deployment, and $pi/lambda^{2}$ per square meter for two and three dimensional terminal-deployments. Lastly, we consider implementations of the LIS in the form of a grid of conventional antenna-elements, and show that the sampling lattice that minimizes the surface-area and simultaneously obtains one independent signal dimension for every spent ante- na is the hexagonal lattice.},

abstract={A massive number of devices are expected to fulfill the missions of sensing, processing and control in cyber-physical IoT systems with new applications and connectivity requirements. In this context, scarce spectrum resources must accommodate high traffic volume with stringent requirements of low latency, high reliability, and energy efficiency. Conventional centralized network architectures may not be able to fulfill these requirements due to congestion in backhaul links. This article presents a novel design of an RDNA for IoT that leverages the latest advances of mobile devices (e.g., their capability to act as access points, storing and computing capabilities) to dynamically harvest unused resources and mitigate network congestion. However, traffic dynamics may compromise the availability of terminal access points and channels, and thus network connectivity. The proposed design embraces solutions at the physical, access, networking, application, and business layers to improve network robustness. The high density of mobile devices provides alternatives for close connectivity, reducing interference and latency, and thus increasing reliability and energy efficiency. Moreover, the computing capabilities of mobile devices project smartness onto the edge, which is desirable for autonomous and intelligent decision making. A case study is included to illustrate the performance of RDNA. Potential applications of this architecture in the context of IoT are outlined. Finally, some challenges for future research are presented.},

abstract={The continuous transfer of messages in vehicular ad hoc networks leads to a heavy network traffic load. This causes congestion in the wireless channel which degrades the reliability of the network and significantly affects the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters such as packet loss, throughput and average delay. Therefore, it is vital to adapt the transmitting data rates in a way that ensure that acceptable performance is achieved and that there is reliable communication of information between vehicles in smart cities. This means the information will be delivered in a timely manner to the drivers, which in turn allows implementation of efficient solutions for improved mobility and comfort in intelligent transportation systems. In this paper, congestion control in the communication channel has been formulated as a non-cooperative game approach and the vehicles act as players in the game to request a high data rate in a selfish way. The solution of the optimal game is presented by using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions and Lagrange multipliers. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves network efficiency in the presence of congestion by an overall average of 50.40%, 49.37%, 58.39% and 36.66% in terms of throughput, average delay, number of lost packets and total channel busy time as compared to Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance mechanism.},

abstract={Numerous IoT devices in wireless network interact and cooperate with each other to achieve diverse intelligent services. Such devices use static channel for wireless transmission, making the whole network vulnerable to eavesdroppers. This raises a need for means to allow secure data transmission/reception between IoT routing nodes. The concept of antenna diversity is used to enhance secrecy capacity by expanding the channel bandwidth trying to confuse attackers. Therefore, an efficient solution is considered by using multiband signal transmitter circuit to enable frequency-manipulation between connected devices. In this paper, we conducted security evaluation based on optimal relay selection protocols to maximize the channel secrecy capacity and improve data transmission. This approach uses channel sensing metric to manipulate the transmission characteristics between legitimate users via changing the operating frequency and bandwidth. Results showed a massive improvement in physical layer security against eavesdropping attack when using reconfigurable frequency bands.},

abstract={Automation of modern industrial plants require real-time tracking of object locations and sensing of local and ambient parameters for variety of applications such as counting and tracking of objects in assembly line, detection and positioning of failures of machines etc. Mostly, discrete Real Time Location System (RTLS) performs object tracking in existing industrial automation without its integration with the sensing and control network, which constrains application's responsiveness. In this paper, we propose an integrated solution of Wireless Positioning Sensor Network (WPSN) that is designed for accuracy, reliability, scalability and optimal network operation. The proposed WPSN is applicable for harsh indoor industrial environments for not only monitoring and control of plant operations but also for identification, localization and tracking of assets and inventory in industrial warehouses. The indoor industrial environment poses challenging conditions for radio signal propagation that adversely affects reliability of communication of sensing and location data. We approach reliability by incorporating redundancy and making our network reconfigurable through adaptive intelligent learning process. We employ adaptive clustering technique to address the need of scalable deployment for varied industrial scenarios. We include hybrid localization scheme to provide high precision positioning but with fallback reduced precision operation to deal with long-term channel impairment. The WPSN is connected with backend cloud infrastructure for low cost monitoring and control.},

abstract={One of the key ingredients of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is delivery of broadcast status messages among vehicles for safety purposes. This requires an efficient Medium Access Control (MAC) that provides low average delay and high reliability. To this end, Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) has been commonly proposed for Vehicle Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). Nevertheless, the hidden- node problem can jeopardize the reliability of CSMA, whereas the latency when accessing the channel can be unbounded. To overcome these limitations, resource allocation based on the geo-location of the vehicles can be applied in VANETs. For example, a distributed location based access (DLOC) algorithm has been proposed such that vehicles access orthogonal resource blocks based on their position, aiming at maximizing the distance of co-channel transmitters. In this paper we propose a stochastic geometry approach to analyze DLOC taking into account path loss and fading as well as the random location of transmitting vehicles. Analytical results include the average interference, average binary rate and capture probability, i.e. probability of successful message transmission. It is shown that increasing the number of RBs increases reliability but there is a trade off between reliability and average BR.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has been growing rapidly due to recent advancements in communications and sensor technologies. Meanwhile, with this revolutionary transformation, researchers, implementers, deployers, and users are faced with many challenges. IoT is a complicated, crowded, and complex field; there are various types of devices, protocols, communication channels, architectures, middleware, and more. Standardization efforts are plenty, and this chaos will continue for quite some time. What is clear, on the other hand, is that IoT deployments are increasing with accelerating speed, and this trend will not stop in the near future. As the field grows in numbers and heterogeneity, “intelligence” becomes a focal point in IoT. Since data now becomes “big data,” understanding, learning, and reasoning with big data is paramount for the future success of IoT. One of the major problems in the path to intelligent IoT is understanding “context,” or making sense of the environment, situation, or status using data from sensors, and then acting accordingly in autonomous ways. This is called “context-aware computing,” and it now requires both sensing and, increasingly, learning, as IoT systems get more data and better learning from this big data. In this survey, we review the field, first, from a historical perspective, covering ubiquitous and pervasive computing, ambient intelligence, and wireless sensor networks, and then, move to context-aware computing studies. Finally, we review learning and big data studies related to IoT. We also identify the open issues and provide an insight for future study areas for IoT researchers.},

The Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) is an intelligent wireless communication organization that is aware of its environment. Here, heterogeneous nodes meet spectrum sensing challenges due to the variation of transmission power, spectrum allocation and sensing bandwidth of the channel. The two main tasks in CRN are primary channel sensing and selection of appropriate unused channel for communication by secondary users. In this paper we present an idea to formulate a contention based channel selection algorithm using priority queue scheduling algorithm.

abstract={This research targets an intelligent spectrum mobility in cognitive radio networks (CRNs). Spectrum mobility could be real spectrum handoff (i.e., the user jumps to a new channel) or wait-and-stay (i.e., the user pauses the transmission for a while until the channel quality becomes good again. An optimal spectrum mobility strategy needs to consider its long-term impact on the network performance, such as flow throughput and packet dropping rate, instead of adopting a myopic scheme that optimizes only the short-term throughput. We thus propose to use a promising machine learning scheme, called Transfer Actor-Critic Learning (TACT), for the spectrum mobility strategies. Such a TACT-based scheme shortens a user's spectrum handoff delay, due to the use of a comprehensive reward function that considers the channel utilization factor (CUF), packet error rate (PER), packet dropping rate (PDR), and flow throughput. Here, the CUF is estimated by a spectrum quality modeling scheme, which considers spectrum sensing accuracy and channel holding time. The PDR is calculated from NPRP M/G/1 queueing model, and the flow throughput is estimated from a link-adaptive transmission scheme, which utilizes the rateless codes. Our simulation results show that the TACT algorithm along with the decoding-CDF model achieves optimal reward value in terms of Mean Opinion Score (MOS), compared to the myopic spectrum decision scheme.},

abstract={In this paper, an intelligent and low power EEG(electroencephalograph) processing multi-QOS(quality of service) DSP has been designed with the smicrf180nm technology used for EEG wearable Instrument. The bio-detection uses the Ag/Ag-Cl electrode sensor to extract the head skin's micro EEG signal, and uses the differential chopper-LNA circuit to cancel the 1/f, dc-offset voltage and other noises. On one hand, the hardware accelerator uses the STFT(short time fourier transform) multiple filtering channels and the HT(hilbert transform) method, for decomposing the instant amplitude envelop and instant frequency of each sub-channel. On the other hand, when the detected SI(sleepiness indicator) signal triggers the minimum 3-stage CPU, the software thread uses the HHT(hilbert huang transform) method to get the IMF(intrinsic mode function) components from the non-statistical and non-stable EEG signal, then the design executes the Tsallis entropy complexity analysis with the pipeline CPU, which consumes about 20pJ/instruction. The transmitter uses ping/pang switching matrix, the burst TD-OFDM (time division-orthogonal frequency division multiplex) scheme and the power-adaptation algorithm to give a balance design between the frequency utility and the energy consumption. To increase the throughput and to decrease power consumption mostly caused by the wireless channel's idle CS (carrier sensing) operation, the channel wake-upping/monitoring and the data transmitting/receiving circuits are separated, which reduces the energy consumption by about 30×. The design uses one-hop star topology to compose the reduced network architecture. Also, the design mainly uses the CG (clock gating) and PG (power gating) methods to decrease the chip's dynamic and leakage energy consumption respectively.},

pages={560-565}, 
abstract={In deep waters, both the natural acoustic systems (such as marine mammals) and artificial acoustic systems (like underwater sensor networks (UWSNs) and sonar users) use acoustic signals for communication, echolocation, sensing, and detection. This makes the channel spectrum, heavily shared by UWSNs posing several salient features such as narrow bandwidth, long propagation delay, and high packet loss caused by acoustic channel. Flooding of data packets in such environment, therefore, is known to be a more appropriate mechanism. Hence, many researchers proposed flooding-based routing protocols for UWSNs such as VBF and HH-VBF. Nevertheless, these known protocols maximize overhead within network due to their dependency on additional parameters such as routing vector. To deviate this overhead and control the flooding, we previously proposed a Directional Flooding Routing (DFR) protocol, which controls the flooding area based on link quality. However, DFR lacks to deal with dynamic changes under the shores due to fixed system parameters throughout the network communications. In this paper, we therefore propose two new DFR protocols, called QA_DFR_AA (QoS-Aware DFR with Angle Adaption) and QA_DFR_TA (QoS-Aware DFR with Threshold Adaption) to reflect QoS dynamically. In addition, we also aid our current DFR with holding time technique to avoid packet collision and redundant packet transmission. Through NS-2 simulations, we found that our new intelligent DFR (iDFR) and two new versions of DFR outperforms the current version of the DFR.},

abstract={Intelligent connected objects, which build the IoT, are electronic devices usually supplied by batteries that significantly limit their life-time. These devices are expected to be deployed in very large numbers, and manual replacement of their batteries will severely restrict their large-scale or wide-area deployments. Therefore energy efficiency is of the utmost importance in the design of these devices. The wireless communication between the distributed sensor devices and the host stations can consume significant energy, even more when data needs to reach several kilometers of distance. In this paper, we present an energy-efficient multi-sensing platform that exploits energy harvesting, long-range communication and ultra-low-power short-range wake-up radio to achieve self sustainability in a kilometer range network. The proposed platform is designed with power efficiency in mind and exploits the always-on wake-up radio as both receiver and a power management unit to significantly reduce the quiescent current even continuously listening the wireless channel. Moreover the platform allows the building of an heterogeneous long-short range network architecture to reduce the latency and reduce the power consumption in listening phase at only 4.6 μW. Experimental results and simulations demonstrate the benefits of the proposed platform and heterogeneous network.},

abstract={At present, spectrum scarcity is a major concern in the field of mobile communication. The necessity of spectrum is increasing gradually because the usage of wireless communication is rising tremendously. Cognitive radio (CR) is capable of dealing with this problem. This is referred to as an intelligent and reconfigurable radio which enables efficient usage of unused spectrum while avoiding any kind of interference. There are two groups of users in cognitive radio network. Primary users (PU) are the authorized users of the frequency band, the secondary users (SU) make use of those bands while primary users don't use those bands. So the unlicensed users i.e secondary users must sense the spectrum holes which are vacate as quickly as possible for conserving this spectrum reuse consequence and if it is detected that the channel is occupied by primary users again, it is obvious that the secondary users should vacate the channel in between a definite amount of time. Hence spectrum sensing plays a vital role in cognitive radio technology. Again, enhancing throughput is one of the fundamental issue in this field. If the sensing time large then CR gets less time to transmit data. Thus, throughput will degrades and if sensing time is low throughput will be high. In our paper, we try to improve throughput for different fading channel in narrowband with the help of a proposed model.},

We investigate the optimal strategy for spoofing, desynchronizing and jamming a cluster-based CR network with a Gaussian noise signal, over a Rayleigh fading channel. The adversary can limit access for secondary users (SUs) by either transmitting a spoofing signal in the sensing interval, or a desynchronizing signal to disrupt code acquisition by SUs or the cluster head. By jamming the network during the transmission interval, the adversary can reduce the rate of successful transmission.

abstract={Cognitive Radio is an intelligent radio designed to automatically detect the best wireless channel in wireless spectrum that is unused at a specific time. It is software defined radio in which the operating parameters such as modulation type, power or spectrum band change by software. Spectrum sensing is one of the most important functions of cognitive radio. It is used to detect the activity of the licensed users in a selected band. This paper used the Energy detection method for spectrum sensing to sense the presence of primary users. The energy detection algorithm is coded in MATLAB to determine the availability of used spectrum of licensed band. Probability of detection is calculated as the ratio between the number of times the signal passes the threshold value and the total number of trails using Monte-Carlo method. Three different modulation techniques BPSK, QPSK and QAM under Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) are specified for increasing signal quality and detection. In this work PD of primary user at lower signal to noise ratio up to -10dB with fixed Probability of false alarm at 0.00001, 0.0001, 0.001 and 0.01 is analyzed. After analysis it is observed that PD increases with increase in PFA. It is also observed that among these modulation techniques, QAM is the best method for the spectrum sensing.},

abstract={The working radio spectrum is a limited precious natural resource. The continuous demand for the available wireless spectrum is characterized by the in technology of wireless devices. Cognitive radio technology helps in this respect for using available spectrum optimally. A cognitive Radio (CR) is an intelligent radio that can be programmed and configured dynamically. It is an hybrid of software defined radio (SDR) which is applied to wireless spectrum communication. It can sense the environment without the involvement of the user and can adapt to user communication needs. It then accordingly changes its transmission or reception parameters. This process leads the cognitive radio for dynamic spectrum management. So we are proposing the scheme for Channel Allocation in Cognitive Radio by using Game Theory by extracting the best of the four individual sensing methods, eliminating the maximum disadvantages of the sensing techniques. We developed the cognitive radio networks and in which we are also balanced the load between all the channels using game theory. We created 5 elements network / 5channel then check the load one by one in these channel or compare all the channel parallel. Suppose one channel have more load then others then we are sorting the channel load and again compare all the channels. But in some critical situation sometimes the load is not change properly, and wherein one channel has more load and other channel has less load then at that time we have to sort very carefully. Suppose one channel have more load then the load has to be reduced by -step and if other channel has less load then it has to be increased by +step. Thus by creating +step or -step load the network has been balanced properly in the channels of cognitive radio network. Numerical results are presented to show that the proposed approach has better effect and capacity.},

abstract={With the increase in utilization of portable devices and ever-growing demand for greater data rates in wireless transmission, an increasing demand for spectrum channels was observed since last decade. Currently, radio spectrum channels are assigned for quite long time periods to licensed subscribers who may not constantly use these bands, which leads to an inefficient use of the radio spectrum. The concept of cognitive radio technology was suggested to deal with the problem of spectrum scarcity caused by the underutilization of the radio spectrum. A cognitive radio system is able to sense its functional and geographical surrounding and adjust its operation. Therefore, cognitive radio operation has to be considered with intelligent sensing and smart decision-making methods.

abstract={In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method to remove haze from a single input image. This method is not only prior on dark channel, but also light. Based on dark channel prior (DCP), a new haze removal scheme is proposed by Dr. He in [6] and it is becoming popular because of its dark channel statistics of outdoor haze-free images. Whereas, there are two problems in the scheme proposed in [6]: the cost of computing the transmission map using soft mapping is high and the atmospheric light is over-exposure when a bright area is shown in images. This paper proposes a novel dehazing algorithm with dark channel and light channel where the light channel is a kind of statistics of outdoor hazy images. Moreover, the guided filter is introduced to refine the dark channel and the light channel in this paper. The objective of proposed dehazing algorithm (PDA) is to alleviate or remove these problems found in [6]. To verify the PDA and compare it with the DCP scheme, several examples are given in this paper. The results show that the PDA is about 25 times faster than the DCP since the soft matting is avoided on average, and visual quality in the PDA without over-exposure problem is better than that in the DCP. With these improvements, the proposed method may be applied in video surveillance, intelligent transportation system and remote sensing.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can utilize the unlicensed industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band to communicate the sensed data. The ISM band has been already saturated due to the overlaid deployment of WSNs. To solve this problem, WSNs have been powered up by cognitive radio (CR) capability. By using CR capability, WSNs can utilize the spectrum holes opportunistically. The sensor nodes, which need large bandwidth to transmit their sensed data from source to destination require some scheme, which should be able to provide them a wide band channel whenever required. Channel bonding (CB) is a technique through which multiple contiguous channels can be combined to form a single wide band channel. By using CB technique, CR-based WSN nodes attempt to find and combine contiguous channels to avail larger bandwidth. In this paper, we show that by increasing the number of channels, the probability of finding contiguous channels decreases. Moreover, we then propose a primary-radio (PR) user-activity-aware CB algorithm and compare it with three state-of-the-art schemes: SWA, KNOWS, and AGILE. It has been demonstrated through extensive NS-2 simulations that intelligent CB decisions can reduce harmful interference to PR nodes. We find that CB in CR sensor networks attempts to provide greater bandwidth and utilizes the spectrum effectively.},

This paper proposes an intelligent extraction method for farmland irrigation and drainage system based on domestic high resolution satellite GF-2 images, which has considered both spectral features and geometry features of farmland irrigation and drainage system, and could be divided into four parts as: image scale converting, spectral model for canal identification, data extraction by spatial features and breakpoint connecting with morphology. The first step is to fuse the 1 meter panchromatic image and 4 meter multi-spectral image by Nearest Neighbor Diffusion pan sharpening algorithm that will output a high resolution multi-spectral image in 1meter. Then, construct a model of spectral relationship by red, green, blue and NIR (Near Infrared Reflection) bands, which will extract irrigation canals initially from images. Then, in order to distinguish roads with irrigation canals, we need to analyze the spatial features of them and design spatial rules to separate these two targets. The last problem is that there would be many disconnected irrigation channels as limited by the resolution of remote sensing images, the mathematical morphology method would be used for judging the topological relationships between breakpoints, which will be connected by dilation operators. This paper chose the Sanhulianjiang reservoir irrigation area to be experimental area, which is located in Hubei's Jiayu County. The main irrigation and drainage facilities in experimental area have been extracted through our method, and are contrasted to the water resource survey data. The comparison shows the accuracy of this method is credible; it could satisfy the needs as large-scale, fast extraction for irrigation and drainage - ystem, which has huge potential in agriculture and water conservancy fields.},

abstract={Cognitive Radio (CR) is an intelligent wireless communication system capable of sensing the environment and making decisions on how to use the available radio resource without creating any harmful interference to licensed users (Primary Users). The intelligent system module of CR provides the ability to gain the knowledge of available spectrum opportunities and reconfigure Radio Frequency (RF) operating parameters. Spectrum Sensing is a key mechanism in CR for acquiring spectrum awareness. The performance of spectrum sensing algorithm degrades due to channel impairments, such as, multipath fading, correlated shadowing and receiver uncertainty issues. To overcome this limitation, Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CSS) was introduced to take the advantage of spatial diversity of wireless receivers. In recent years, cooperative sensing based on Machine learning has been used to improve the efficiency of learning in CR. Cooperative learning can help a CR to learn the surrounding environment and improves sensing accuracy. In this paper, we propose unsupervised Archetypal Clustering approach in which the local energy vectors are decomposed into a collection of extreme points which are called Archetypes. Archetypal Clustering has similar flavor to the well-known K-means clustering, while the later provides an average view on the data, the former provides an extremal view. The performance of proposed algorithm is quantified in terms of target Probability of detection and false-alarm to meet the requirement of IEEE 802.22 Wireless Regional Area Network (WRAN) standard. Further, we compare our results with k-means clustering and Support Vector Machine (SVM).},

pages={536-549}, 
abstract={Distributed spectrum access (DSA) is challenging, since an individual secondary user often has limited sensing capabilities only. One key insight is that channel recommendation among secondary users can help to take advantage of the inherent correlation structure of spectrum availability in both time and space, and enable users to obtain more informed spectrum opportunities. With this insight, we advocate to leverage the wisdom of crowds, and devise social recommendation aided DSA mechanisms to orient secondary users to make more intelligent spectrum access decisions, for both strong and weak network information cases. We start with the strong network information case where secondary users have the statistical information. To mitigate the difficulty due to the curse of dimensionality in the stochastic game approach, we take the one-step Nash approach and cast the social recommendation aided DSA decision making problem at each time slot as a strategic game. We show that it is a potential game, and then devise an algorithm to achieve the Nash equilibrium by exploiting its finite improvement property. For the weak information case where secondary users do not have the statistical information, we develop a distributed reinforcement learning mechanism for social recommendation aided DSA based on the local observations of secondary users only. Appealing to the maximum-norm contraction mapping, we also derive the conditions under which the distributed mechanism converges and characterize the equilibrium therein. Numerical results reveal that the proposed social recommendation aided DSA mechanisms can achieve a superior performance using real social data traces and its performance loss in the weak network information case is insignificant, compared with the strong network information case.},

abstract={We propose a distributed Learning Automata (LA) for spectrum management problem in Cognitive Radio (CR) networks. The objective is to design intelligent Secondary Users (SUs) which can interact with the RF environment and learn from its different responses through the sensing. It is assumed there is no prior information about the Primary Users (PUs) and other SUs activities while there is no information exchange among SUs. Each SU is empowered with an LA which operates in the RF environment with different responses. That is, the SUs are considered as agents in a self-organized system which select one channel as an action and receive different responses from the environment based on how much their selected actions are favorable or unfavorable. Using these responses, SUs control their accesses to the channels for appropriate spectrum management with the objective to incur less communication delay, less interference with PUs, and less interference with other SUs. The proposed LA-based distributed algorithm is investigated in terms of asymptotic convergence and stability. Simulation results are provided to show the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of SUs' waiting times, interference with other SUs, the number of interruptions by PUs during their transmissions, and fairness.},

abstract={We consider video transmission over a mobile cognitive radio (CR) system operating in a hostile environment where an intelligent adversary tries to disrupt communications. We investigate the optimal strategy for spoofing, desynchronizing, and jamming a cluster-based CR network with a Gaussian noise signal over a slow Rayleigh fading channel. The adversary can limit access for secondary users (SUs) by either transmitting a spoofing signal in the sensing interval, or a desynchronizing signal in the code acquisition interval. By jamming the network during the transmission interval, the adversary can reduce the rate of successful transmission. We show how the adversary can optimally allocate its energy across subcarriers during sensing, code acquisition, and transmission intervals. We determine a worst-case optimal energy allocation for spoofing, desynchronizing, and jamming, which gives an upper bound to the received video distortion of SUs. We also propose cross-layer resource allocation algorithms and evaluate their performance under disruptive attacks.},

abstract={IEEE 802.11p is an amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard for Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE). Lower layer wireless transmission formats and protocols are defined for both vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-vehicle communication links to support cooperative intelligent transport systems. The medium access control (MAC) layer uses carrier sensing as a means for detecting the busy state of the radio channel before transmitting. In heavily loaded vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), the channel access delay, when attempting to access the channel, unpredictably increases when it is sensed as busy. The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) defines safety-related messages. These messages require a dependable behavior of the communication link. In this context, dependable behavior translates to the reliable delivery of data packets within a specified deadline regardless of changes in traffic density. Unfortunately, the WAVE amendment does not fulfill the requirements for such dependable behavior. This contribution reports on performance evaluations by simulation studies of the WAVE MAC and the decentralized congestion control (DCC) mechanism specified by the ETSI in addition to the existing enhanced distributed channel access. The simulation scenario under study is a two-VANET-merging highway situation. The MAC protocol has to adapt to variable traffic densities in this scenario. The performance is evaluated in terms of coverage range and MAC-to-MAC delay reliability and DCC state stability. Furthermore, a novel performance indicator is defined, evaluated, and discussed, which the authors of this work have named data novelty. Finally, a multistate-active DCC mechanism is proposed, which achieves a dependable behavior.},

abstract={A system for monitoring and forecasting urban air pollution is presented in this paper. The system uses low-cost air-quality monitoring motes that are equipped with an array of gaseous and meteorological sensors. These motes wirelessly communicate to an intelligent sensing platform that consists of several modules. The modules are responsible for receiving and storing the data, preprocessing and converting the data into useful information, forecasting the pollutants based on historical information, and finally presenting the acquired information through different channels, such as mobile application, Web portal, and short message service. The focus of this paper is on the monitoring system and its forecasting module. Three machine learning (ML) algorithms are investigated to build accurate forecasting models for one-step and multi-step ahead of concentrations of ground-level ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). These ML algorithms are support vector machines, M5P model trees, and artificial neural networks (ANN). Two types of modeling are pursued: 1) univariate and 2) multivariate. The performance evaluation measures used are prediction trend accuracy and root mean square error (RMSE). The results show that using different features in multivariate modeling with M5P algorithm yields the best forecasting performances. For example, using M5P, RMSE is at its lowest, reaching 31.4, when hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is used to predict SO2. Contrarily, the worst performance, i.e., RMSE of 62.4, for SO2 is when using ANN in univariate modeling. The outcome of this paper can be significantly useful for alarming applications in areas with high air pollution levels.},

abstract={The opening of the ultrahigh frequency (UHF) TV band by the Federal Communications Commission for opportunistic operation promises to relieve the demand on the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands. However, supporting bandwidth-intensive applications over TV white spaces can be quite challenging, due to the unpredictable nature of spectrum availability and the fluctuations in channel quality. The realization of this Herculean feat through unlicensed usage, while providing protection to licensed primary users, requires intelligent and adaptive protocol design. In this paper, we propose a quality-of-service-aware parallel sensing/probing architecture (QASPA), which exploits inherent channel and user diversity exhibited by the wireless system. Aiming at maximizing the sensing efficiency while achieving high detection accuracy, QASPA incorporates an optimal adaptive double-threshold-based sensing mechanism. It also embodies a cross-layer protocol, which uses an adaptive framing structure to minimize the control overhead, as well as a novel spectrum assignment strategy targeted at improving the spatial reuse of the network. The proposed spectrum assignment strategy supports both channel bonding and aggregation. Our simulations validate the ability of QASPA in guaranteeing the demands of high-bandwidth opportunistic flows while supporting low-bandwidth flows. They also show the superior performance of QASPA compared with the scheme used in the ECMA-392 standard for opportunistic indoor streaming.},

pages={325-334}, 
abstract={In this paper, we develop a cognitive radio (CR)-based architecture for fourth generation (4G) users that provides real-time delivery of service to its applications through the intelligent assignment of the CR spectrum. CRs work in an unlicensed network setting, so it is important that cognitive users utilize the spectrum opportunistically, i.e., without interrupting the licensed user's activity. To provide the opportunistic access for a cognitive 4G user, we propose an architecture that delivers the desired solution by following a novel five-step process. First, the cognitive (or secondary) user relays its throughput requirements from the application layer down to the media access layer by way of cross-layering. Second, the media access layer at its end senses the licensed spectrum and, based on the sensed parameters, characterizes the licensed (or primary) user's amount of spectrum occupancy into three different occupancy level types. Third, the licensed user's spectrum occupancy, categorized into three levels, is statistically represented by setting up a Markov model that evaluates the probability that the licensed channel could be found in a particular state at a given time instant for each level. Fourth, to provide opportunistic spectrum access to the secondary user, an optimization strategy is devised in the media access control layer that will bring face to face the throughput requirements obtained from the application layer and the steady-state probabilities for the licensed channel from the physical layer. Fifth, optimal performance metrics concerning the 4G user throughput and power are attained by solving the optimization problem. Results obtained are simulated against a variety of network parameters, and performance improvement through the proposed scheme is assessed by simulations conducted for a long-term evolution (LTE) system.},

Despite the wealth of research on intelligent transportation systems, contemporary analytical tools are often inadequate for handling the data with the character of large volume, sparseness, and heterogeneity, let alone for supporting interactive visual analysis for data-intensive applications. Visual analytics can build bridges between the capability of data processing and human intelligence to promote addressing various transportation problems. On one hand, by employing visual channels to represent datasets and transforming various types of data into appropriate visual components, visualization can enhance understanding and analysis. On the other hand, an interactive interface allows users to investigate and directly access selected data points or features, discover interesting patterns or events, and engage in visual reasoning that allows users to gain insights, e.g., it is desirable to only show the most relevant portions of a dataset while giving directions for potential exploration.},

abstract={By providing information about the objects that are non-line of sight and/or beyond the detection range of the local sensors, inter-vehicle communication compensates for the limitations of vehicle tracking subsystem in automated driving systems that relies on on-board sensing devices. Tracking capability in such systems can further be improved by making optimal use of the communication channel through sharing of locally created map data instead of transmitting only beacon messages. Message length adaptation, together with transmit rate control can address the scalability issue inherent in the vehicular network. The content of the exchanged information is another important aspect that has significant impact on the map accuracy in cooperative driving systems. In this paper, we study different congestion and content control schemes for a communication architecture aimed at map sharing, and evaluate their performance in terms of a situational awareness metric, namely position tracking error. This paper determines that message content should be concentrated on mapped objects that are located farther away from the sender, but near the edge of local sensor range. This paper also finds that optimized combination of message length and transmit rate ensures the optimal channel utilization for cooperative vehicular communication, which in turn improves the situational awareness of the whole system.},

abstract={There are different forms of uncertainty in satellite communications, including cognitive interferers, channel conditions, packet traffic, and spectrum occupancy of users across channels. In addition, delay (such as propagation delay observed over satellite links) increases spectrum uncertainty and makes spectrum sensing and spectrum access two challenging tasks. To address such challenges, this paper presents a regret minimization solution for primary user (PU) and secondary user (SU) spectrum access to satellite resources in the presence of cognitive interferers. This robust game theoretic solution supports hierarchical spectrum sharing and dynamic spectrum access over multiple channels. Users select channels for data transmission and perform power control to optimize individual utility functions that are random due to different forms of uncertainty. The proposed game engine based on regret minimization framework provides a low-complexity and fast solution compared to traditional game solutions based on expected utility maximization. Detailed numerical results evaluate throughput and delay of PUs and SUs in the presence of cognitive interferers and compare the robust game theory-enabled approach with two benchmark schemes (with and without knowledge on channel availability). To support controllable and repeatable test and evaluation with real radios, an emulation testbed is built with software-defined radios connected with a network channel emulator that generates channel, mobility, and interference effects for satellite communications. GNU Radio modules are developed for cognitive network functionalities and run on USRP N210 radios that represent SU, PU, interferer and satellite nodes. Emulation tests validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution under real radio effects.},

abstract={Wireless sensor network (WSN) suffer uncontrolled interference while using license free spectrum due to the increasing crowd in the band. The cognitive radio (CR) is a promising solution for this problem. CR technology can be applied in WSN to form cognitive radio sensor network (CRSN). With the consideration of energy consumption of channel sensing and switching, when the sensor nodes should sense and switch to a licensed channel due to increased packet loss rate in licensed free channel can be determined. Two dynamic channel accessing schemes are proposed for intra-cluster data transmission and inter-cluster data transmission. The opportunistic channel sensing improves the energy efficiency in CRSNs. And also an asynchronous sleep-wake scheduling mechanism is used for reducing energy consumption. This scheduling mechanism allows the sensor nodes to sleep when the nodes are not participating in data transmission, by that network lifetime can be increased. Simulation results demonstrate that the channel accessing schemes and asynchronous sleep-wake scheduling scheme can significantly reduce the energy consumption and effectively achieves network lifetime extension in CRSNs.},

abstract={Cognitive Radio (CR) is one of the well developed technologies extensively used for raising the spectrum performance for constructing opportunistic transmission links. Sustaining to the routing function on top of opportunistic links is a mandatory for transporting packets in a CR Ad hoc Network (CRAHN) holding the cooperative relay multi-radio systems. However, there is insufficient understanding of these highly dynamic opportunistic links, bandwidth, throughput, Link duration, Spectrum propagation and a reliable end-to-end transportation mechanism over the CRAHN. To elucidate these problems two Spectrum Map Opportunistic Routing (SMOR) algorithms such as SMOR-1 and SMOR-2 are proposed for regular and large-scale CRAHNs with wireless fading channels. However satisfying the network bandwidth, delivery ratio and the analysis to deal with transmission delay over such opportunistic links becomes important aspect. In order the solve the case and meet above stated limitations Hybrid Firefly Simulated Annealing based Spectrum Opportunistic Routing Algorithm(HFSA-SORA) is projected to the concerning of the spectrum map from local and global spectrum sensing information. A key beneficence of this HFSA-SORA is to the map the above mentioned metrics, and local Primary User (PU) interference observations in the direction of a packet forwarding delay over the opportunistic links. This permits the multipath formation undertaken over a large-scale CRAHNs to grasp the environmental and spectrum information for all the intermediate nodes, thereby degrading the computational overhead at the endpoint. From the theoretical derivations, propose HFSA-SORA for regular and large-scale CRAHNs with wireless fading channels, employing a cooperative networking scheme to enable multipath transmissions. Simulations substantiate that HFSA-SORA solutions enjoy significant breakage of end-to-end delay, reduction of network bandwidth, and minimum packet loss, attain a higher throughput and lesser c- mmunication overhead for CRAHNs.},

abstract={With the rapid development of cloud computing, big data, robotic cloud and other emerging technologies, more and more intelligent machines and terminals are now embedded with sensors or actuators that need continuous connectivity over the Internet. Terminals attached to the 5G edges are expected to have sophisticated cognitive capabilities to satisfy future IoT services and application. The enabler for such smart services is the capability to establish low throughput connectivity channel across various terminals roaming in the globe to support real time collaborative decisions. Existing mobility protocols and routing standards are inefficient to support such requirement as of their centralized design concept that enforces round trip propagation delay and induces high latency as of excess tunnel headers and signaling overheads. This research establishes a real prototype to illustrate how Software Defined Networking (SDN) can be adopted to automatically established overlay networks over any hybrid infrastructure that can be geographically separated by WAN to provide seamless LAN extension. SOAP overlays identify terminals during the dynamic IP allocation of their join processes and connect them regardless of their location with minimum latency and delay. The overlay network can be expanded cross service providers managed by different SDN controllers. The evaluation of SOAP performance shows strong advancement over existing protocols as of eliminating signaling overheads and restricting tunnel usage to shared paths for connecting WAN separated providers. SOAP ensures wire speed performance inside provider and delivers feasible solution across providers under direct/indirect service level agreements.},

pages={1-1}, 
abstract={Attaining the vision of Smart Cities requires the deployment of an enormous number of sensors for monitoring various conditions of the environment ranging from air quality to traffic. Backscatter sensors have emerged to be a promising solution for two reasons. First, transmissions by backscattering allow sensors to be powered wirelessly by radio-frequency waves, overcoming the difficulty in battery recharging for billions of sensors. Second, the simple backscatter hardware leads to low-cost sensors suitable for large-scale deployment. On the other hand, backscatter sensors with limited signal-processing capabilities are unable to support conventional algorithms for multiple access and channel training. Thus, the key challenge in designing backscatter sensor networks is to enable readers to accurately detect sensing values given simple ALOHA random access, primitive transmission schemes, and no knowledge of channel states and statistics. We tackle this challenge by proposing the novel framework of backscatter sensing (BackSense) featuring random encoding at backscatter sensors and statistical inference at readers. Specifically, assuming the widely used on/off keying for backscatter transmissions, the practical random-encoding scheme causes the on/off transmission of a sensor to be randomized and follow a distribution parameterized by the sensing values. Facilitated by the scheme, statistical inference algorithms are designed to enable a reader to infer sensing values from randomized transmissions by multiple backscatter sensors. The specific design procedure involves the construction of Bayesian networks, namely deriving conditional distributions for relating unknown parameters and variables (including sensing values, noise power, sensing measurements, number of active sensors) to signals observed by the reader. Then based on the Bayesian networks and the well-known expectation-maximization principle, inference algorithms are derived to recover sensing values. Simul- tion of the BackSense system demonstrates high accuracy in reader inference despite the mentioned limitations of backscatter sensors, which grows with increasing numbers of received symbols and reader antennas.},

abstract={We propose a pseudo-determined blind source separation framework that exploits the information from a large number of microphones in an ad-hoc network to extract and enhance sound sources in a reverberant scenario. After compensating for the time offsets and sampling rate mismatch between (asynchronous) signals, we interpret as a determined $Mtimes M$ mixture the over-determined $Mtimes N$ mixture, where $M>N$ is the number of microphones and $N$ is the number of sources. Next, we propose a pseudodetermined mixture model that can apply an $Mtimes M$ independent component analysis (ICA) directly to the $M$ -channel recordings. Moreover, we propose a reference-based permutation alignment scheme that aligns the permutation of the ICA outputs and classifies them into target channels, which contain the $N$ sources, and nontarget channels, which contain reverberation residuals. Finally, using the signals from nontarget channels, we estimate in each target channel the power spectral density of the noise component that we suppress with a spectral postfilter. Interestingly, we also obtain late-reverberation suppression as by-product. Experiments show that each processing block improves incrementally source separation and that the performance of the proposed pseudodetermined separation improves as the number of microphones increases.},

This paper is dedicated to designing a framework of multi-channel touch sensing via integrating multiple IBM trackpoints, which can be used in six DOF joystick designs, gripper designs and so on. The framework is capable of accommodating up to eight trackpoints with a maximum of sixteen degrees of freedom. Experimental tests has verified that our solution is feasible and reliable. Besides, the cost of the whole framework is very low, not to mention the supreme scalability. It is found that the cycle time of this framework is less than one hundred milliseconds by using the serial communication. Consequently, it has much practical value in occasions where the outer sample frequency is less than 10 Hz. This framework can be integrated in specific applications with the design of the trackpoint locations and the algorithm for the trackpoint outputs.},

pages={121-125}, 
abstract={We propose a novel coding scheme for the unsourced multiple access channel model introduced by Polyanskiy [1]. This new paradigm is composed of four main ingredients: (i) the transmission period is partitioned into sub-blocks, thereby instituting a slotted framework; (ii) The message (data) is split into two parts and one part chooses an interleaver for a low density parity check (LDPC) type code. This part of the message is encoded using spreading sequences or codewords that are designed to be decoded by a compressed sensing type decoder; (iii) The other part of the message is encoded using a low density parity check (LDPC) type code and decoded using a joint message passing decoding algorithm designed for the T-user binary input real adder channel; (iv) users repeat their codeword in multiple sub-blocks, with the transmission pattern being a deterministic function of message content and independent of the identity of the user. When this coding scheme is combined with serial interference cancellation, the ensuing communication infrastructure can offer significant performance improvements compared to the recently proposed coding scheme in [2] and results in the best performing coding scheme to date.},

abstract={By enabling sensor nodes to opportunistically access licensed channels, CRSN can provide a spectrum-efficient networking solution in the era of the Internet of Things. On the other hand, it also consumes extra energy for spectrum sensing and switching. This is a double-edged sword posing a dilemma between spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency. Recent advances in RF energy harvesting and transfer promote RF-powered CRSN in providing a promising way to address this challenge. In RF-powered CRSNs, sensor nodes can dynamically access the vacant licensed channels for interference-free data transmission and can also utilize the strong signals over the occupied licensed channels for energy harvesting. In this article, we investigate RF energy harvesting and transfer in CRSNs. We first introduce the architecture and advantages of RF-powered CRSN, typical applications, as well as the key challenges arising from applying RF energy harvesting and transfer into CRSN. We then propose a resource allocation framework to demonstrate how to jointly control the dynamic channel access and energy management to optimize network utility while guaranteeing network stability and sustainability. Some future directions are finally envisioned for further research.},

A total of four channels are used in representing EEG frontal asymmetry, consisting of the left and right hemisphere of the brain. Arousal and valence for two-dimensional emotion models are used in classifying four basic emotions; happy, sad, angry, and relaxed. The mirror neuron system (MNS) for emotion elicitation is utilized in finding correlation between participant's emotion rating and EEG data. This is achieved by showing images and music to each participant. These images are used to elicit emotions in applying the imitation concept. In addition, an emotion recognition method based on a combination of two algorithms, fractal dimension for feature extraction and multidimensional direct information on finding correlation between left and right EEG frontal asymmetry is proposed. Good performances are achieved from the combination and rating process, where it can be utilized to indicate correlation between participants rating and EEG recorded data. The final results of the EEG recorded data are represented as robot emotions. Therefore, the main contribution is to create a real-time emotional interaction based on the analyzed EEG recorded data.},

The proposed paper focuses on presenting a low cost sensor based human gesture recognition for the game of Hand Cricket. Hand cricket is a popular game in south Asian countries which involves the use of human finger gestures to score. This game is generally played between two players. Each player has a pre-defined gestures for the scores one, two, three, four and six. Both the players are made to wear the Myo armband. Myo armband is used to capture the Bio-potentials triggered during every muscle action. The various gestures performed in this game triggers various muscle group signals. A data set is created by collecting the eight channel bio potentials for every gesture made by both the players. The obtained data set is pre-processed and feature extracted. Now the Machine Learning techniques are performed in the data set to classify all the five different gestures with maximum accuracy. Support Vector Machine (SVM) gave the maximum accuracy to the classify the data set of both the players. The efficiency obtained for both the players are 92% and 84%. The proposed system is made to train with the data set obtained by the two players and the game is played in real time with the help of two MATLAB in two computers.

abstract={Underwater communication is particularly challenging for small submarine robots that have limited power and size constraints. Inspired by weakly electric fish, a novel electric current communication (termed electrocommunication) system has been developed for small underwater robots in our previous studies. However, collision problems sometimes occur during multiple robots communication because the electrocommunication network shares a common channel. In this paper, a new CSMA/CA-based electrocommunication system is presented to solve this collision problem. An efficient circuit for communication channel state (busy or idle) detection is proposed. After that, a compact Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) algorithm is introduced and finally implemented on the system to judiciously avoid collision during multiple robot communication. The effectiveness of the proposed CSMA/CA-based communication system for underwater robot groups is well verified by both simulations and experiments with three robotic fish models.},

abstract={The successes of teleoperation scenarios for mobile robots depends on a stable and reliable communication link. The environment information collected by the robot - represented by 2D or 3D images - has to be provided with a high resolution and a low delay to ensure a fast and precise system response. But in most realistic applications, the communication parameters fluctuate strongly over time. It is necessary to monitor the communication link continuously to react in case of reduced bandwidth and increased delay. But which environment information and correspondingly which bandwidth is necessary to control a robot safely? Due to a missing reliable rule set we investigated this question for a UAV scenario based on two different environment representations (camera images, gridmaps). We designed a simulator based study and evaluated the capability of the participants to control a robot in case of delayed or coarsely rasterized information. Although our study involved only non-experts, we found some interesting first results. While the performance of our participants depends strongly on the delay, it is nearly independent on the image resolution, which suggests downsampling as a valid response for bandwidth decrease. We also found that participants generally struggle with using grid map for controlling the robot. However, this type of interfaces requires far less bandwidth than images. They also excel in situations with higher delays, which makes them the tool of choice when there are really bad channel conditions.},

abstract={This paper introduces Salient Depth Partitioning (SDP), a depth-based region cropping algorithm devised to be easily adapted to existing detection algorithms. SDP is designed to give robots a better sense of visual attention, and to reduce the processing time of pedestrian detectors. In contrast to proposal generators, our algorithm generates sparse regions, to combat image degradation caused by robot motion, making them more suitable for real-world operation. Furthermore, SDP is able achieve real-time performance (77 frames per second) on a single processor without a GPU. Our algorithm requires no training, and is designed to work with any pedestrian detection algorithm, provided that the input is in the form of a calibrated RGB-D image. We tested our algorithm with four state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors (HOG and SVM [1], Aggregate Channel Features [2], Checkerboards [3], and R-CNN [4]), and show that it improves computation time by up to 30%, with no discernible change in accuracy.},

abstract={Inspired by findings of sensorimotor coupling in humans and animals, there has recently been a growing interest in the interaction between action and perception in robotic systems [1]. Here we consider perception and action as two serial information channels with limited information-processing capacity. We follow [2] and formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes utility under limited information-processing capacity in the two channels. As a solution we obtain an optimal perceptual channel and an optimal action channel that are coupled such that perceptual information is optimized with respect to downstream processing in the action module. The main novelty of this study is that we propose an online optimization procedure to find bounded-optimal perception and action channels in parameterized serial perception-action systems. In particular, we implement the perceptual channel as a multi-layer neural network and the action channel as a multinomial distribution. We illustrate our method in a NAO robot simulator with a simplified cup lifting task.},

The robots developed so far are either rather expensive or unsuitable for manipulation tasks. This article presents the result of a project which wishes to demonstrate the feasibility of an affordable humanoid robot. R1 is able to navigate, and interact with the environment (grasping and carrying objects, operating switches, opening doors etc). The robot is also equipped with a speaker, microphones and it mounts a display in the head to support interaction using natural channels like speech or (simulated) eye movements. The final cost of the robot is expected to range around that of a family car, possibly, when produced in large quantities, even significantly lower. This goal was tackled along three synergistic directions: use of polymeric materials, light-weight design and implementation of novel actuation solutions. These lines, as well as the robot with its main features, are described hereafter.},

abstract={Mobile robots, be it autonomous or teleoperated, require stable communication with the base station to exchange valuable information. Given the stochastic elements in radio signal propagation, such as shadowing and fading, and the possibilities of unpredictable events or hardware failures, communication loss often presents a significant mission risk, both in terms of probability and impact, especially in Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) operations. Depending on the circumstances, disconnected robots are either abandoned, or attempt to autonomously back-trace their way to the base station. Although recent results in Communication-Aware Motion Planning can be used to effectively manage connectivity with robots, there are no results focusing on autonomously re-establishing the wireless connectivity of a mobile robot without back-tracing or using detailed a priori information of the network. In this paper, we present a robust and online radio signal mapping method using Gaussian Random Fields, and propose a Resilient Communication-Aware Motion Planner (RCAMP) that integrates the above signal mapping framework with a motion planner. RCAMP considers both the environment and the physical constraints of the robot, based on the available sensory information. We also propose a self-repair strategy using RCMAP, that takes both connectivity and the goal position into account when driving to a connection-safe position in the event of a communication loss. We demonstrate the proposed planner in a set of realistic simulations of an exploration task in single or multi-channel communication scenarios.},

First, we divide the point cloud into two groups: ground and nonground points. Next, we segment clusters in each scanline dataset from the group of nonground points. Each scanline cluster is joined with other scanline clusters using the flood-fill algorithm. In this manner, each group of scanline clusters represents an object in the 3D environment. Finally, we obtain each object separately. Experiments show that our method has the ability to segment objects accurately and in real time.},

pages={858-863}, 
abstract={This paper presents the joint design of network coding and backpressure algorithm for cognitive radio networks and its implementation with software-defined radios (SDRs) in a high fidelity network emulation testbed. The backpressure algorithm is known to provide throughput optimal solutions to joint routing and scheduling for dynamic packet traffic. This solution applies to cognitive radio networks with spectrum dynamics changing over time and space, and supports joint routing and spectrum access without any need for end-to-end path maintenance. The backpressure algorithm is extended to multicast traffic with network coding deployed over virtual queues that represent different flows per session and destination. This extension is supported with different methods to decode packets at destinations. In the absence of a common control channel, distributed coordination with local information exchange is used to support neighborhood discovery, spectrum sensing and channel estimation that are integrated with joint routing, channel access and network coding. Cognitive network functionalities are implemented with GNU Radio and Python modules for different network layers, and used with USRP N210 radios. Practical radio implementation issues are addressed in a distributed wireless network setting, where USRP N210 radios communicate with each other through RFnest, a high fidelity wireless network emulation tool. RFnest provides realistic physical channel environment by digitally controlling path loss, fading, delay, topology and mobility effects. Extensive emulation test results are provided to assess throughput, backlog and energy consumption and verify the SDR implementation of joint network coding and backpressure algorithm under realistic channel and radio hardware effects.},

abstract={Recently emerging wireless sensor technologies integrate different types of sensor nodes in a network for information collection. The heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) imposes complex design challenges as nodes in such a network often have different requirements in terms of latency and bandwidth. Therefore, the channel access for nodes needs to be managed ensuring differentiated quality of service for each priority. This paper aims at developing and evaluating a distributed congestion control scheme for CSMA to make it feasible for prioritized heterogeneous traffic. For this purpose, a model earlier developed for 802.15.4 has been enhanced and integrated with the duty-cycled CSMA. Heterogeneous Traffic of three different priorities has been used for evaluating the performance of proposed scheme. The scheme has been implemented in nes-C for the mica2 platform. It has been revealed that for heterogeneous traffic, the throughput of CSMA integrated with our proposed scheme has a significant advantage over basic CSMA.},

abstract={Cooperative spectrum sensing is a powerful sensing approach which is based on sharing information about channel activities among secondary users (SUs). Cooperative spectrum sensing aims to overcome hidden node problem, shadowing and fading problems, it also enhances sensing accuracy. However, sensing accuracy may degrade due to various reasons: if environmental properties are poor or intra-node characteristics are continuously altering. Thus, this paper proposes a novel approach of a multi-stage hybrid cooperative spectrum sensing model. The first stage, integrates a fuzzy logic system for local fusion center, whereby SU-mobility and its environmental properties, and its neighbors' environmental properties are included in local sensing decision process. Second stage proposes a neural network, based on backpropagation learning algorithm, for global fusion center. All SUs transmit their sensing information, local decision, and their intra-node characteristics to be augmented for an optimized global sensing decision. Neural network is trained based on a real-world measured power dataset. Extensive simulations on the proposed multi-stage model were performed. The results showed high robustness against instantaneous changes in SU-mobility levels and good detection performance at very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. The proposed prediction model outperformed the state-of-the-art work with high detection accuracy at very poor environmental conditions and at different speeds levels.},

abstract={Geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel describes the channel impulse response (CIR) in the sense of rays and clusters, which obey the empirical distributions. Thus, the correlation between MIMO sub-channels is not explicitly defined, which makes it difficult for GBSM to predict channel capacity accurately. Facing the increased antenna number of massive MIMO for fifth generation (5G) communication, we propose a channel modeling method using principal component analysis (PCA). This method takes advantage of the hidden features and structures extracted from the measured channel data, combining the information of the scenario and antenna configurations, to reconstruct the amplitude and phase of the CIR respectively. The sparse features and structures can efficiently support the high antenna number of massive MIMO. By the proposed scheme, the accuracy of 56 × 32 MIMO capacity improves 12.8% compared with the GBSM model.},

abstract={The wireless communication system are facing the spectrum shortage and interference problem for the latest developments in the cellular industry. These problems can be solved by using a new technology known as Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) where dynamic utilization of spectrum takes place. Cognitive Radio is an intelligent transceiver system that continuously monitors its radio environment in search of the unused frequency slots (known as spectrum holes) which can be seen in the environment, analyze and take decisions from threshold. This frequency slots are used up by secondary user in the absence of primary user. In this paper, we have analyzed four different types of spectrum sensing techniques, challenges faced by spectrum sensing method and strategies to solve this problem.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been widely studied for decades due to their superior characteristics and promising applications. However, multi-hop WSNs suffer from serious collisions caused by hidden terminals, resulting in the decline of network performance and lifetime. Contention-free media access control (MAC) protocols can strictly avoid conflicts through channel resource partitioning. In this paper, we investigate MAC protocols using the code division multiple access (CDMA) mechanism to resolve collision problems in WSNs. We perform a comparative study of existing CDMA-based protocols and evaluate their performance through theoretical analyses and simulation results. The remaining challenges and future works are also presented. We develop a novel MAC protocol that combines CDMA with carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA).},

abstract={Recently, smart robots and smart systems have acquired extensive research. Combination of control engineering along with automation engineering and artificial intelligence has given birth to the next generation robotic systems and modern control engineering. Intelligent agent which is considered as the basic building block is discussed in this paper then based on the theory of artificial intelligence, image processing and control system a robotic model which is called a Combi-Forklift robot is proposed. Different kind of machines have been researched which are named as robot. Some of them contain complex mechanical structure, others contain of complex electrical circuits and some of them are designed based on extensive work of programming. Some robots recognize voice, while other recognizes the image. Some are good in audio communication and some are combined with all such properties in a human like body. Moreover, robots have been researched and designed based on application, model or domain. In this paper we have proposed a combi-forklift robot by implementing a sensor network as an agent of artificial intelligence. The sensor network acts as the intelligent interface between the human being and the robot in a way that it observes the motion and gesture of human being and communicates the commands to our designed robot in order to perform application based activities. Since the indoor sensor network based system acts as intelligent agent, therefore the outdoor combi-forklift robot acts as the effector.},

pages={537-553}, 
abstract={In this paper, we consider the sum secrecy rate maximization problem in multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems in the presence of multiple energy harvesters (EHs) which also have potential to wire-tap the information users (IUs). To facilitate delivering secure information to the IUs and increase the total harvested energy by the EHs simultaneously, we optimize the transmit beamforming vectors to direct the information signals toward the IUs and artificial noise (AN) toward the EHs. We assume that each EH relies on itself to decode the information signal intended for an individual IU. Therefore, the corresponding problem is to maximize the worst-case sum secrecy rate under transmit power and energy harvesting constraints. The problem is optimally solved by transforming it into a convex iterative program using a change of variables, semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and linearization of quadratic terms. We prove that rank-one optimal solutions for the IUs beamforming covariance matrices can be obtained from the optimal relaxed unconstrained solution. Also, we provide three suboptimal solutions based on null space projection and power control of the beamforming vectors for the low and high harvested energy constrained regions. A special case of cooperative EHs in which the EHs can collaboratively cancel the signal of all IUs except the one they intend to eavesdrop is also investigated, and the optimal solution is derived in a comparable way as in noncooperative EHs case. Our simulation results reveal an understanding of how the tradeoff between the AN and information signal can jointly improve both the sum secrecy rate and the total harvested energy. We also show that, within the low total harvested energy region, the suboptimal solution in which the AN is projected in the null space of the IUs channels outperforms the suboptimal solution which ignores AN alignment at the IUs, and vice versa over the high total harvested energy region; and- the suboptimal solution that combines both of them achieves close to optimal performance.},

abstract={Robots working with humans are expected to be more adaptive to failures of tasks and to have easier communication channels with those co-working humans. With this goal in mind, this paper presents a motion recognition framework for robots including a success/failure classification of tasks based on natural language representation. The proposed method consists of three parts: motion language model, natural language model and hierarchical task description. It realizes motion recognition by natural language using motion information of task execution including success and failures. When a sentence is given to the system, a state in the task description is evoked. Through the process, hierarchical relation between states is considered. The proposed framework was implemented and experiments confirmed that the proposed method identifies various motion types and provides natural language expressions. It was also confirmed that hierarchical relations among task representations are reflected to language recognition results.},

abstract={Digital Beamforming (DB) in satellite communication (SATCOM) has drawn significant attention in recent years. DB design is flexible and adaptive among frequencies, bandwidths, and interferences. In this work, we design a cognitive radio testbed for SATCOM for digital beamforming design and implementation. The testbed is capable of simultaneously capturing signals from multiple antennas. Considering the conditions of jamming or interference, the design implements spectrum detection and compressive sensing for channel condition monitoring in a real time. Using the analyzed jammer and interference information, the incoming signal can be moved into a different frequency where the channel is vacant or at least meets acceptable conditions. The beamforming design is also adaptive to the frequency where each beam is weighted differently for a given channel condition. In addition, the satellite antenna array is used to determine the signal direction of arrival (DoA), The DB is capable of forming the beam in the direction that avoids interference and jamming. Moreover, the detection of the jamming signal direction can help localize the jammer. In the testbed design, a Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) is used as a radio frequency (RF) front end component and GNU radio connecting to computer as signal processing back end. The system architecture includes the transponder receiver. And a USRP ×310 with twinRx receiver is capable of obtaining multiple copies of the signal captured by multiple receiving antennas.},

abstract={The Underwater Acoustic Communication (UAC) systems work in communication channels characterized by a large variety of multipath propagation conditions that can additionally change over time. Designing a reliable communication system requires knowledge of the transmission parameters of the channel. There is a need for the development of adaptive signaling schemes that would dynamically optimize the signal parameters of the physical layer of communication protocols. Wireless channels are often assumed to be wide sense stationary (WSS) with uncorrelated scattering (US). The WSSUS assumption allows for simultaneous modeling of time dispersion leading to the frequency selectivity of the channel, and time variability resulting in frequency dispersion. However, in the case of many underwater communication channels, especially when system terminals are in movement, the channel can be modeled as WSSUS only in restricted periods of time, and in limited frequency ranges. The paper presents a method for determining the time interval, wherein the WSS assumption is fulfilled, on the basis of a complex envelope of the received bandpass signal.},

abstract={Energy harvesting is a promising technology for the Internet of Things (IoT) towards the goal of self-sustainability of the involved devices. However, the intermittent and unreliable nature of the harvested energy demands an intelligent management of devices' operation in order to ensure a sustained performance of the IoT application. In this work, we address the problem of maximizing the quality of the reported data under the constraints of energy harvesting, energy consumption and communication channel impairments. Specifically, we propose an energy-aware joint source-channel coding scheme that minimizes the expected data distortion, for realistic models of energy generation and of the energy spent by the device to process the data, when the communication is performed over a Rayleigh fading channel. The performance of the scheme is optimized by means of a Markov Decision Process framework.},

abstract={Multi-rate forward erasure correction (FEC)-applied wireless multicast enables reliable and efficient video multicast with intelligent selection of physical (PHY) layer data rate and FEC rate. The optimal PHY/FEC rates depend on the cause of the packet losses. However, previous approaches select the PHY/FEC rates by considering only channel errors even when interference is also a major source of packet losses. We propose InFRA, an interference-aware PHY/FEC rate adaptation framework that (i) infers the cause of the packet losses based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and cyclic redundancy check (CRC) error notifications, and (ii) determines the PHY/FEC rates based on the cause of packet losses. Our prototype implementation with off-the-shelf chipsets demonstrates that InFRA enhances the multicast delivery under various network scenarios. InFRA enables 2.3x and 1.8x more nodes to achieve a target video packet loss rate with a contention interferer and a hidden interferer, respectively, compared with the state-of- the-art PHY/FEC rate adaptation scheme. To our best knowledge, InFRA is the first work to take the impact of interference into account for the PHY/FEC rate adaptation.},

abstract={This paper introduces a new class of microwave sensor architecture using direct conversion principle to eliminate data processing and provide low-power smart sensor nodes. Using a six-port circuit as the modulator, the sensing data are up-converted directly to a microwave frequency and sent by an antenna. At the receiver, a six-port circuit is used as a demodulator to down-convert the received signal and extract the sensing data. To predict the communication channel of the sensor network and provide a robust connection, a pilot sequence is sent along with the sensor data which is used in the calibration procedure at the receiver for accurate extraction of sensing data and making sensors smarter. Any kind of microwave sensors based on the variation of impedance can be used in the proposed structure. In this paper, the capacitive loading is used as a material sensor. By variation of material in the sensing area, the impedance of the load and reflection coefficient (Γ) are changed. Then, the amplitude and phase of Γ are transmitted via the six-port circuit, received in the network base station, and analyzed to find the material changes.

pages={10858-10870}, 
abstract={This paper addresses the distributed secure estimation problem over wireless sensor networks subject to random multichannel jamming attacks. Each sensor's measurement is divided into ny (the dimension of measurement signal) components and transmitted via ny relevant wireless channels. The attacker is an active adversary in the sense that sensors' measurements through wireless transmission channels are randomly dropped if the corresponding channels are successfully jammed. By employing a piecewise homogeneous Markov chain, a sophisticated two-level switching multichannel jamming attack model is developed. From the perspective of the attacker, this attack model is promising and makes the wireless channels highly vulnerable, because the attacker can randomly and arbitrarily decide when and where to launch the attacks. We then focus our attention on the secure estimation of a target signal with the caveat that some of the measurements can be incomplete induced by the attacks. A system theoretic framework is then developed to cast the network-based security problem into an H∞ estimation theory problem of a piecewise homogeneous Markov jump system. Criteria for analyzing H∞ estimation performance and designing resilient estimators against noises and attacks are also presented. The effectiveness of the proposed results is illustrated through a military F404 aircraft engine system.},

First, one Kinect frame is processed to generate three separate images, including depth image, RGB color image, and S channel image in HSI color space. The images are processed with depth threshold, green enhancement and saturation threshold correspondingly. And a frontground mask image will be generated with the processed images through intersection and union operations. Second, depth gray image and color gray image will be filtered with the frontground mask. And candidate fruit regions can be obtained after open-close reconstruction.

abstract={Pilot reuse in the multi-cell massive multi-input multi-output system is investigated where user groups with different priorities exist. Recent investigation on pilot reuse has revealed that when the ratio of the coherent time interval to the number of users is reasonably high, it is beneficial not to fully reuse pilots from interfering cells. This paper finds the optimum pilot assignment strategy that would maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) given the user groups with different priorities. A closed-form solution for the optimal pilot assignment is derived and is shown to make intuitive sense. Performance comparison shows that under wide range of channel conditions, the optimal pilot assignment that uses extra set of pilots achieves better WSR performance than conventional full pilot reuse.},

year={2017}, 
volume={PP}, 
number={99}, 
pages={1-1}, 
abstract={This paper addresses the problem of lossy outsourcing, i.e., clients outsource computation needs to the cloud side through lossy channels, which is very common in practice. We focus on the case that the clients transmit 2D sparse signals to the semi-trusted clouds over packet-loss networks, and the clouds provide sparse robustness decoding service (SRDS) for the users. In order to achieve high level of efficiency and security, we propose to jointly exploit parallel compressive sensing for robust signal encoding and employ multiple cloud servers for SRDS. Specifically, prior to encoding, a signal is encrypted by only altering the indices and amplitudes of its non-zero entries. The encrypted signal is sensed using a Gaussian measurement matrix and the generated compressive measurements are then sent to multi-clouds for SRDS, along with the occurrence of packet loss. Each column in compressive measurements can be regarded as a packet and each description consists of a certain number of packets. Each description together with a small portion of support set is distributed to a cloud. When receiving the request from a user, each cloud performs SRDS using the acquired description, where the reconstructed signal is still in encrypted form so that the signal privacy is well preserved. After receiving the reconstructed signal, the user accomplishes the decryption operation. Experimental results show that the encryption algorithm improves compressibility and reconstruction performance compared with the case of no encryption, and the proposed privacy-assured outsourcing of SRDS is highly robust and efficient.},

abstract={Extracting and analyzing affective knowledge from social media in a structured manner is a challenging task. Decision makers require insights into the public perception of a company's products and services, as a strategic feedback channel to guide communication campaigns, and as an early warning system to quickly react in the case of unforeseen events. The approach presented in this article goes beyond bipolar metrics of sentiment. It combines factual and affective knowledge extracted from rich public knowledge bases to analyze emotions expressed toward specific entities (targets) in social media. The authors obtain common and common-sense domain knowledge from DBpedia and ConceptNet to identify potential sentiment targets. They employ affective knowledge about emotional categories available from SenticNet to assess how those targets and their aspects (such as specific product features) are perceived in social media. An evaluation shows the usefulness and correctness of the extracted domain knowledge, which is used in a proof-of-concept data analytics application to investigate the perception of car brands on social media in the period between September and November 2015.},

abstract={Vehicular Communication Systems also known as Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication systems (V2V) are standardized by the IEEE 802.11p standard which specifies the use of Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) in the physical layer. Doppler shift due to high mobility along with multipath propagation in vehicular environments result in a time-varying multipath or a doubly selective channel. The estimation of such a channel and its subsequent equalization is a non-trivial task [1]. Several techniques for the estimation and equalization of a doubly selective channel have been proposed in literature. However, these techniques either perform poorly or work with a complexity that is prohibitive for consumer hardware [2]. We propose the Matching Pursuit (MP) algorithm, a Compressed Sensing (CS) scheme to perform the task of channel estimation. We also propose modifications to this algorithm that are focused to reduce the computational complexity. We further show that the channel estimate from the MP algorithm can be used by both conventional and state-of-art equalizers. The proposed algorithms are implemented as a Software-Defined Radio (SDR), that provides an excellent platform for design, development and the ability to perform simulation as well as real-world experiments. Simulation results assess the performance gains of the proposed channel estimation and equalization schemes.},

abstract={The principle and performance of optical stealth communication technique is summarized and its applications to smart sensor networks are proposed. Optical stealth communication, which is also known as optical steganography, hides information in wide band analog noise. The wide band and fast changing noise protects the stealth information from being detected and recorded by an eavesdropper. If the matching condition cannot be achieved when receiving the stealth information, the information is permanently lost and cannot be recovered by post-processing techniques. The optical stealth communication technique is proposed to protect the sensing information in smart sensor networks. Private information in both the fronthaul connections and the communications between the sensor nodes and the wireless stations can be hidden in the optical stealth communication channels.},

abstract={The research challenge of current Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is to design energy-efficient, low-cost, high-accuracy, self-healing, and scalable systems for applications such as environmental monitoring. Traditional WSNs consist of low density, power-hungry digital motes that are expensive and cannot remain functional for long periods on a single charge. In order to address these challenges, a dumb-sensing and smart-processing architecture that splits sensing and computation capabilities among tiers is proposed. Tier-1 consists of dumb sensors that only sense and transmit, while the nodes in Tier-2 do all the smart processing on Tier-1 sensor data. A low-power and low-cost solution for Tier-1 sensors has been proposed using Analog Joint Source Channel Coding (AJSCC). An analog circuit that realizes the rectangular type of AJSCC has been proposed and realized on a Printed Circuit Board for feasibility analysis. A prototype consisting of three Tier-1 sensors (sensing temperature and humidity) communicating to a Tier-2 Cluster Head has been demonstrated to verify the proposed approach. Results show that our framework is indeed feasible to support large scale high density and persistent WSN deployment.},

abstract={The field of flexible electronics is rapidly evolving. The ultrathin chips are being used to address the high-performance requirements of many applications. However, simulation and prediction of changes in response of device/circuit due to bending induced stress remains a challenge as of lack of suitable compact models. This makes circuit designing for bendable electronics a difficult task. This paper presents advances in this direction, through compressive and tensile stress studies on transistors and simple circuits such as inverters with different channel lengths and orientations of transistors on ultrathin chips. Different designs of devices and circuits in a standard CMOS 0.18-μm technology were fabricated in two separated chips. The two fabricated chips were thinned down to 20 μm using standard dicing-before-grinding technique steps followed by post-CMOS processing to obtain sufficient bendability (20-mm bending radius, or 0.05% nominal strain). Electrical characterization was performed by packaging the thinned chip on a flexible substrate. Experimental results show change of carrier mobilities in respective transistors, and switching threshold voltage of the inverters during different bending conditions (maximum percentage change of 2% for compressive and 4% for tensile stress). To simulate these changes, a compact model, which is a combination of mathematical equations and extracted parameters from BSIM4, has been developed in Verilog-A and compiled into Cadence Virtuoso environment. The proposed model predicts the mobility variations and threshold voltage in compressive and tensile bending stress conditions and orientations, and shows an agreement with the experimental measurements (1% for compressive and 0.6% for tensile stress mismatch).},

abstract={This paper presents a robust dynamic spectrum access (DSA) decision making framework for a satellite communication (SATCOM) system with primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs) operating in the presence of cognitive jammers. Different levels of uncertainty are considered for the channel availability under SATCOM delays and jamming effects. Spectrum uncertainty is quantified regarding the parameter estimation for Markov model of spectrum occupancy and the prediction of future channel states under SATCOM delays. Based on these uncertainty models, the optimal spectrum sensing approach is used to identify available channels. Both offline and online algorithms are used for DSA. Offline algorithm first learns spectrum dynamics and then applies DSA, whereas online learning repeats this process and adapts to fast spectrum dynamics. Results show performance gains of DSA over the case without considering spectrum uncertainty.},

A truly cognitive device, however, needs to exhibit a certain degree of intelligence to draw optimum decisions based on prior observations and anticipated actions. Said intelligence comes along with a high complexity and poor convergence, which currently prevents any viable deployment of cognitive networks. However, the recently introduced and largely unexplored concept of docitive networks, where more expert nodes teach less expert nodes, allows both cognitive complexity as well as convergence to be significantly reduced. These achieved performance gains can be translated into energy gains, which will be focus of this paper. The baseline scenario is an ultra-high capacity network topology envisaged in beyond next-generation deployments offering capacity in the order of 1Gbps/km2. We show that, in dependency of the required download volumes, a docitive deployment offers significant energy gains over a cognitive one. Typically, shorter download volumes yield larger gains.},

abstract={Prime design goals for next-generation wireless networks to support emerging applications are spectral efficiency and low operational cost. Among a gamut of technical solutions, cognitive approaches have long been perceived as a catalyst for the above goals by facilitating the coexistence of primary and secondary users by means of efficient dynamic spectrum management. While most available techniques today are essentially opportunistic in nature, a truly cognitive device needs to exhibit a certain degree of intelligence to draw optimum decisions based on prior observations and anticipated actions. Said intelligence however, comes along with high complexity and poor convergence, which currently prevents any viable deployment of cognitive networks. We thus introduce an emerging and largely unexplored concept of docitive networks, where nodes effectively teach other nodes with the prime aims of reducing cognitive complexity, speeding up the learning process, and drawing better and more reliable decisions. To this end, we review some important concepts borrowed from the machine learning community for both centralized and decentralized systems, in order to position the emerging docitive with known cognitive approaches. Finally, we validate introduced concepts in the context of a primary digital television system dynamically coexisting with IEEE 802.22 secondary networks. For this scenario, we demonstrate the superiority of various unprecedented docitive over known opportunistic/cognitive algorithms.},

abstract={End-to-end learning of communications systems is a fascinating novel concept that has so far only been validated by simulations for block-based transmissions. It allows learning of transmitter and receiver implementations as deep neural networks (NNs) that are optimized for an arbitrary differentiable end-to-end performance metric, e.g., block error rate (BLER). In this paper, we demonstrate that over-the-air transmissions are possible: We build, train, and run a complete communications system solely composed of NNs using unsynchronized off-the-shelf software-defined radios and open-source deep learning software libraries. We extend the existing ideas toward continuous data transmission, which eases their current restriction to short block lengths but also entails the issue of receiver synchronization. We overcome this problem by introducing a frame synchronization module based on another NN. A comparison of the BLER performance of the “learned” system with that of a practical baseline shows competitive performance close to 1 dB, even without extensive hyperparameter tuning. We identify several practical challenges of training such a system over actual channels, in particular, the missing channel gradient, and propose a two-step learning procedure based on the idea of transfer learning that circumvents this issue.},

abstract={In order to cope with the challenges of increasing user bandwidth demands as well as create new revenues by offering innovative services and applications, Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are willing to increase their networks' capabilities by making it more flexible, programmable and agile. MNOs are also seeking new technologies to benefit from recent advances in cloud for rapid deployments and elastically scaling services that cloud providers are mostly benefiting today. On one hand, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) concept can be helpful for enabling network infrastructure sharing/slicing and elasticity for “softwarization” of network elements. On the other hand, machine learning and game-theoretical concepts can also be utilized to address network management and orchestration needs of services and applications and improve network infrastructure's operational needs. In that regard, joint utilization of machine learning, game theoretical approaches and SDN concepts for network slicing can be beneficial to MNOs as well as infrastructure providers. In this paper, we utilize regret-matching based learning approach for efficient Radio Remote Head (RRH) assignments among MNOs in software-defined based cloud radio access network (C-RAN). Using game-theoretical approach, we demonstrate convergence of RRH allocations to mixed strategy Nash equilibrium and present significant performance improvements compared to traditional assignment approach.},

Hybrid TDMA-CSMA can be a proper MAC candidate in such scenario benefiting from both the TDMA isolation power and the CSMA opportunistic nature. In this paper, we propose a dynamic MAC that schedules high-traffic users in the TDMA phase with variable size to be determined. Then, the rest of active users compete to access the channel through CSMA. The objective is to search for a scheduling that maximizes the expected sum throughput subject to SP reservations. In the absence of arrival traffic statistics, this scheduling is modeled as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, in which each arm corresponds to a possible scheduling. Due to the dependency between the arms, existing policies are not directly applicable in this problem. Thus, we present an index-based policy where we update and decide based on learning indexes assigned to each user instead of each arm. To update the indexes, in addition to TDMA information, observations from CSMA phase are used, which adds a new exploration phase for the proposed MAB problem. Throughput and isolation performance of the proposed self-exploration-aided index-based policy (SIP) are evaluated by numerical results.},

abstract={Channel switching in HSPA networks is used to reduce the channel occupancy when there is no data transfer for the given user, this way reducing battery consumption. This paper is the first dealing with another important aspect that is the CPU load on the radio network controller (RNC) caused by channel switching. This is an optimization task, in which both the channel switching and staying on the high-bandwidth channel have costs. In this paper we propose a system to minimize the costs by applying a predictor based method which uses time slice based features in order to reduce the high variance in the feature values. The proposed system is evaluated and compared to other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={Network slicing is a fundamental capability for future Fifth Generation (5G) networks to facilitate the cost-effective deployment and operation of multiple logical networks over a common physical network infrastructure in a way that each logical network (i.e. network slice) can be customized and dimensioned to best serve the needs of specific applications (e.g. mobile broadband, smart city, connected car, public safety, fixed wireless access) and users (e.g. general public, enterprise customers, virtual operators, content providers). The practical realization of such capability still raises numerous technical challenges, both in the Core and RAN parts of the 5G system. Through a comprehensive analysis of the impact that the realization of RAN slicing has on the different layers of the radio interface protocol architecture, this article proposes a framework for the support and specification of RAN slices based on the definition of a set of configuration descriptors that characterize the features, policies and resources to be put in place across the radio protocol layers of a next-generation RAN node.},

abstract={This paper addresses the slicing of radio access network resources by multiple tenants, e.g., virtual wireless operators and service providers. We consider a criterion for dynamic resource allocation amongst tenants, based on a weighted proportionally fair objective, which achieves desirable fairness/protection across the network slices of the different tenants and their associated users. Several key properties are established, including: the Pareto-optimality of user association to base stations, the fair allocation of base stations' resources, and the gains resulting from dynamic resource sharing across slices, both in terms of utility gains and capacity savings. We then address algorithmic and practical challenges in realizing the proposed criterion. We show that the objective is NP-hard, making an exact solution impractical, and design a distributed semi-online algorithm, which meets performance guarantees in equilibrium and can be shown to quickly converge to a region around the equilibrium point. Building on this algorithm, we devise a practical approach with limited computational information and handoff overheads. We use detailed simulations to show that our approach is indeed near-optimal and provides substantial gains both to tenants (in terms of capacity savings) and end users (in terms of improved performance).},

abstract={Network slicing is a fundamental capability for future 5G networks to properly support current and envisioned future application scenarios. Network slicing facilitates a cost-effective deployment and operation of multiple logical networks over a common physical network infrastructure such that each network is customized to best serve the needs of specific applications (e.g., mobile broadband, Internet of Things applications) and/or communications service providers (e.g., special purpose service providers for different sectors such as public safety, utilities, smart city, and automobiles). Slicing a RAN becomes particularly challenging due to the inherently shared nature of the radio channel and the potential influence that any transmitter may have on any receiver. In this respect, this article analyzes the RAN slicing problem in a multi-cell network in relation to the RRM functionalities that can be used as a support for splitting the radio resources among the RAN slices. Four different RAN slicing approaches are presented and compared from different perspectives, such as the granularity in the assignment of radio resources and the degrees of isolation and customization.},

abstract={The next 5G infrastructure is expected to serve a multitude of services with heterogeneous requirements, which might be potentially managed by multiple Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) that share the same network infrastructure. The new emerging technologies, such as i) Software Defined Networking (SDN), ii) Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and iii) Network Slicing, where physical resources are partitioned and allocated in an isolated manner to a set of services or to MVNOs according to a specific Service Level Agreement (SLA), are seen as the key enabling approaches to fulfill the diversity of requirements of 5G services in a cost-effective manner.

The aim of our work is to validate the feasibility of the prototype in handling the creation and configuration of network slices on-demand, taking into account some requirements that are elaborated from SDN-based slicing applications. By means of emulations, we show that our prototype reacts well to the inputs coming from the SDN application and is finally capable of providing isolation among multiple slices in a dynamic fashion.},

abstract={Tactile Internet (TI) will generate a variety of 5G-enabled use cases with different requirements for latency, throughput and reliability. In this paper, we propose a flexible cloud-based radio access network (FRAN) for TI, where traffic of user equipments (UEs) can be temporary offloaded from the operator-provided networks to user- provided networks if needed. Such a concept enables dynamic network slicing (DNS) where the network architecture is temporally augmented with slices of infrastructure borrowed from user provided network. FRAN is able to support Tactile applications without any basic change to the hardware/software infrastructure in the network. We model DNS system as a two-layer/slice traffic- aware resource allocation framework, where every layer uses a separate two-step matching game in order to serve Tactile users (TUs) and low- priority users (LUs). We propose a subgame Nash stable and two-sided exchange stable concepts as solutions of the proposed two-layer traffic-aware resource allocation. Our numerical results show that network operators and UEs (either TUs or LUs) significantly benefit from deploying the FRAN rather than conventional cloud-based radio access networks (CRANs).},

abstract={Multitenant cellular network slicing has been gaining huge interest recently. However, it is not well-explored under the heterogeneous cloud radio access network (H-CRAN) architecture. This paper proposes a dynamic network slicing scheme for multitenant H-CRANs, which takes into account tenants' priority, baseband resources, fronthaul and backhaul capacities, quality of service (QoS) and interference. The framework of the network slicing scheme consists of an upper-level, which manages admission control, user association and baseband resource allocation; and a lower-level, which performs radio resource allocation among users. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a higher network throughput, fairness and QoS performance compared to several baseline schemes.},

abstract={To satisfy diverse use cases and business models in fifth generation (5G) wireless communication, network slicing in fog radio access networks (F-RANs) is proposed, which provides a cost efficient networking in a convenient way. However, the resource management for network slices is challenging, especially when the edge caching is utilized to alleviate the fronthaul burden and reduce the delay. In this paper, we investigate the joint sub-carrier allocation and caching placement for two network slices, and an average delay optimization problem for one slice with user data rate guarantee for the other slice is formulated, which can be solved by a two-step iterative algorithm. The core idea is to optimize decoupled variables iteratively via Hungarian method, linear integer programming, and geometric programming(GP) with the help of decomposition. Simulation results reveal a fast convergence speed and a near-optimal performance of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract={Network slicing has been advocated by both academia and industry as a cost-efficient way to enable operators to provide networks on an as-a-service basis and meet the wide range of use cases that the fifth generation wireless network will serve. The existing works on network slicing are mainly targeted at the partition of the core network, and the prospect of network slicing in radio access networks should be jointly exploited. To solve this challenge, enhanced network slicing in F-RANs, called access slicing, is proposed. This article comprehensively presents a novel architecture and related key techniques for access slicing in F-RANs. The proposed hierarchical architecture of access slicing consists of a centralized orchestration layer and a slice instance layer, which makes access slicing adaptively implementable in a convenient way. Meanwhile, key techniques and their corresponding solutions, including radio and cache resource management as well as social-aware slicing, are presented. Open issues in terms of standardization developments and field trials are identified.},

abstract={We consider the resource allocation for the virtualized OFDMA uplink cloud radio access network (C-RAN), where multiple wireless operators (OPs) share the C-RAN infrastructure and resources owned by an infrastructure provider (InP). The resource allocation is designed through studying tightly coupled problems at two different levels. The upper-level problem aims at slicing the fronthaul capacity and cloud computing resources for all OPs to maximize the weighted profits of OPs and InP considering practical constraints on the fronthaul capacity and cloud computation resources. Moreover, the lower-level problems maximize individual OPs' sum rates by optimizing users' transmission rates and quantization bit allocation for the compressed I/Q baseband signals. We develop a two-stage algorithmic framework to address this two-level resource allocation design. In the first stage, we transform both upper-level and lowerlevel problems into corresponding problems by relaxing underlying discrete variables to the continuous ones. We show that these relaxed problems are convex and we develop fast algorithms to attain their optimal solutions. In the second stage, we propose two methods to round the optimal solution of the relaxed problems and achieve a final feasible solution for the original problem. Numerical studies confirm that the proposed algorithms outperform two greedy resource allocation algorithms and their achieved sum rates are very close to sum rate upper-bound obtained by solving relaxed problems. Moreover, we study the impacts of different parameters on the system sum rate, performance tradeoffs, and illustrate insights on a potential system operating point and resource provisioning issues.},

pages={1741-1753}, 
abstract={In this paper, we conceive an advanced small cells wireless network deployment framework within a managed space under shared spectrum access paradigm. We also conceive a complementary business model, referred to as neutral host micro operator (NH-μO), that leverages a single shared wireless infrastructure to mutually benefit μO (a third party service provider), the owner of the space/facility, and mobile network operators (MNOs). The model is composed of a μO slice, which delivers a venue with customized wireless services tailored to the its local service requirements, and an MNO slice, which facilitates improved wireless coverage to visitors/end-users with subscriptions to several different MNOs. The NH-μO is not biased to favor any specific client, which can be enforced through a concrete commercial agreement. A radio access network slicing concept is exploited to support and optimize both the slice instances (SIs) efficiently in a shared manner on a single physical network infrastructure. In addition, we devise an efficient architecture for the NH-μO small cell base station and dynamic spectrum assignment control unit, and their required functionalities supporting sustainable coexistence of different SIs in shared spectrum. We also devise both interSI and intra-SI dynamic spectrum allocation policies considering time-varying requirements of different SIs. These policies take care of application level priority by providing a proper mixture of users with guaranteed quality of service and best-effort users, while ensuring a healthy SI competition. The advantages of the proposed framework are twofold. It enables the venue owner to manage its wireless networks and consider its very specific requirements while capitalizing from the MNO slice. This, in turn, reduces the need for deployment of new infrastructure while providing improved wireless coverage and savings to MNOs.

abstract={Network slicing has been identified as the backbone of the rapidly evolving 5G technology. However, as its consolidation and standardization progress, there are no literatures that comprehensively discuss its key principles, enablers and research challenges. This paper elaborates network slicing from an end-to-end perspective detailing its historical heritage, principal concepts, enabling technologies and solutions as well as the current standardization efforts. In particular, it overviews the diverse use cases and network requirements of network slicing, the pre-slicing era, considering RAN sharing as well as the end-to-end orchestration and management, encompassing the radio access, transport network and the core network. This paper also provides details of specific slicing solutions for each part of the 5G system. Finally, this paper identifies a number of open research challenges and provides recommendations towards potential solutions.},

abstract={Network slicing is considered a key technology for the upcoming 5G system, enabling operators to efficiently support multiple services with heterogeneous requirements, over a common shared infrastructure. In this demo, we present a prototype for managing network slices in the Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN), which is considered the reference network architecture for 5G. Our prototype deals with the spectrum slicing problematic and aims at efficiently sharing the bandwidth resources among different slices, while considering their requirements. The prototype makes use of the Open Air Interface (OAI) platform and a specific Software Defined Network (SDN) controller, known as FlexRAN. By using real smart-phones, we run experiments on stage to validate the feasibility of the prototype in configuring multiple slices on-demand, driven by the input of a northbound application.},

abstract={Network softwarization is a major paradigm shift, which enables programmable and flexible system operation in challenging use cases. In the fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks, the more advanced scenarios envision transfer of high-rate mission-critical traffic. Achieving end-to-end reliability of these stringent sessions requires support from multiple radio access technologies and calls for dynamic orchestration of resources across both radio access and core network segments. Emerging 5G systems can already offer network slicing, multi-connectivity, and end-to-end quality provisioning mechanisms for critical data transfers within a single software-controlled network. While these individual enablers are already in active development, a holistic perspective on how to construct a unified, service-ready system as well as understand the implications of critical traffic on serving other user sessions is not yet available. Against this background, the paper first introduces a softwarized 5G architecture for end-to-end reliability of mission-critical traffic. Then, a mathematical framework is contributed to model the process of critical session transfers in a softwarized 5G access network and the corresponding impact on other user sessions is quantified. Finally, a prototype hardware implementation is completed to investigate the practical effects of supporting mission-critical data in a softwarized 5G core network as well as substantiate the key system design choices.},

abstract={An important target for 5G networks is to enable resource sharing among network tenants such as Mobile Virtual Network Operators and Service Providers. Several domains of resource sharing have been considered including infrastructure (compute, storage and networking), transport, Radio Access Network (RAN) and Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum. RAN and spectrum sharing are expected to be an integral part of a multi-tenant 5G network. In this paper, a centralized, fine-grained active RAN and spectrum sharing approach has been presented and analyzed using a modified SimuLTE model. The presented model can be used for analyzing active RAN and spectrum sharing models considered in a multi-tenant 5G network. We present the core modules that enable dynamic allocation of RAN slices with dedicated spectrum and resource scheduling functions. We also present preliminary simulation results that give an insight into the actual benefits and trade-offs of active spectrum sharing among RAN tenants at different time-frequency granularities.},

abstract={Exponential rise in wireless data demands is already creating a significant burden on current mobile networks. Meanwhile, the upcoming 5G system is believed to consist of heterogeneous access networks. The user satisfaction and radio resource efficiency are the main challenges for the network convergence. Network virtualization technology is regarded as an effective solution to above challenges. Heterogeneous networks are virtualized to multiple logical slices to best serve specific services. Two fundamental questions are how to virtualize mobile resources among different slices, and how to shield the impact of time-varying wireless channel on slicing with Quality of Service (QoS) guaranteed. In order to solve these two problems, we propose a two-timescale Virtualized Radio Resource Pre-Allocation mechanism, consisting of the inter-slice pre-allocation and the intra-slice scheduling. Specifically, the subcarrier and transmission power are jointly optimized and the base station coordination is also supported. For different network deployment scenarios, both the centralized and distributed solutions are provided. Simulation results demonstrate that both solutions are able to guarantee the QoS with the minimum requirements of radio resource.},

It is a new radio access technology that provides building blocks to retrofit existing platforms (e.g., 2G, 3G, 4G, and WiFi) for greater coverage, accessibility, and higher network density with respect to cells and devices. It implies that 5G aims to satisfy a diverse set of communication requirements of the various stakeholders. Among the stakeholders, vehicles, in particular, will benefit from 5G at both the system and application levels. The authors present a tutorial perspective on vehicular communications using the building blocks provided by 5G. First, we identify and describe key requirements of emerging vehicular communications and assess existing standards to determine their limitations. Then we provide a glimpse of the adopted 5G architecture and identify some of its promising salient features for vehicular communications.

The present work identifies a variety of challenges to be fulfilled by the 5G ESSENCE in the scope of an enhanced architectural framework. The proposed technical approach exploits the profits of the centralisation of Small Cell functions as scale grows through an edge cloud environment based on a two-tier architecture with the first distributed tier being for offering low latency services and the second centralised tier being for the provision of high processing power for computing-intensive network applications. This permits decoupling the control and user planes of the Radio Access Network (RAN) and achieving the advantages of Cloud-RAN without the enormous fronthaul latency restrictions. The use of end-to-end network slicing mechanisms allows for sharing the related infrastructure among multiple operators/vertical industries and customizing its capabilities on a per-tenant basis, creating a neutral host market and reducing operational costs.},

abstract={Efficient communications are of paramount importance to improve public safety (PS) operations allowing better coordination, higher situation awareness, lower response times, and higher efficiency during emergency. Consequently, the evolution of PS communication networks toward commercial broadband networks is widely well accepted. However, this evolution has to cope with several challenges, such as the provision of sufficient communication capacity, coverage, and resilience as well as deployment costs and efficient exploitation of radio resources. This has triggered the need of new architectural solutions. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous network communication architecture where both infrastructures and spectrum are shared between PS and commercial operators thus reducing deployment costs and times, and addressing the main challenges of PS communications. The shared radio access network (RAN) is managed by means of network slicing and resources virtualization. The proposed architecture is based on a three-tier scheduler that allows to manage different network layers and different RAN slices. Numerical results derived by means computer simulations are provided in order to highlight the efficiency and flexibility of the proposed architecture in comparison with benchmark alternatives.},

abstract={Recent studies argue that optimizing the utilization of the density of the radio access network plays a crucial role in fully attaining the spectral efficiency of modern ultra-dense networks. This insight implicitly unveils a trade-off between the management of spectrum resource and the network density that offers new angles to systematically optimize the network spectral efficiency. Leveraging this tradeoff, this article proposes a framework for joint management of spectrum and network density in ultra-dense networks where the frequency spectrum and the density of the radio access network are treated as resources to be jointly optimized to improve the network spectral efficiency. The generality of this approach is demonstrated in several scenarios, including spectrum and network density management for network slicing, and spectrum sharing among multiple operators of co-located ultra-dense networks. In the process, we also discuss centralized and distributed architectural solutions for spectrum management where a network operator is granted either exclusive or non-exclusive access to a portion of the shared spectrum band.},

abstract={5G requires a redesign of transport networks in order to feed the increasingly bandwidth hungry radio access networks and to benefit from the performance/cost efficiency provided by the integration of both backhaul and fronthaul segments over the same transport substrate as well as the incorporation of cloud RAN architectures. In addition, to increase its usage and cost efficiency, this new transport network should allow simultaneous use by different tenants (e.g. MVNOs, OTTs, and vertical industries). This article presents the 5G transport network architecture designed in the 5G-Crosshaul project to address this challenge. An SDN/NFV-based control plane has been designed that enables multi-tenancy through network slicing. The proposed solution allows for flexible and efficient allocation of transport network resources (networking and computing) to multiple tenants by leveraging on widespread architectural frameworks for NFV (ETSI NFV) and SDN (e.g., Open Daylight and ONOS).},

For the latter, some key RAN/CN interface considerations and the interactions with CN given different protocols and quality of service models are investigated.},

abstract={In order to cope with the challenges of increasing user bandwidth demands as well as create new revenues by offering innovative services and applications, Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are willing to increase their networks' capabilities by making it more flexible, programmable and agile. MNOs are also seeking new technologies to benefit from recent advances in cloud for rapid deployments and elastically scaling services that cloud providers are mostly benefiting today. On one hand, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) concept can be helpful for enabling network infrastructure sharing/slicing and elasticity for “softwarization” of network elements. On the other hand, machine learning and game-theoretical concepts can also be utilized to address network management and orchestration needs of services and applications and improve network infrastructure's operational needs. In that regard, joint utilization of machine learning, game theoretical approaches and SDN concepts for network slicing can be beneficial to MNOs as well as infrastructure providers. In this paper, we utilize regret-matching based learning approach for efficient Radio Remote Head (RRH) assignments among MNOs in software-defined based cloud radio access network (C-RAN). Using game-theoretical approach, we demonstrate convergence of RRH allocations to mixed strategy Nash equilibrium and present significant performance improvements compared to traditional assignment approach.},

abstract={The design of exceptionally-strong security and privacy in an ultra-dense green 5G Deterministic Radio Access Network (DRAN) for the Internet of Things (IoT) is proposed. The ultra-dense DRAN exploits fiber-optics and 802.11ad Multi-GHz WiFi technology to transport both fronthaul and backhaul traffic in a unified low-cost Crosshaul network. The Crosshaul network is similar to a very large highly-utilized IEEE Time Synchronized Channel Hopping (TSCH) network, where collision-free scheduling becomes critical. Traditional Omnidirectional Antennas and Media-Access-Control (MAC) protocols cannot be used with 5G systems. This paper shows that the combination of: (1) a centralized SDN control-plane, (2) deterministic low-jitter scheduling, and (iii) lightweight encryption in layer 2, offers a new approach for wireless security and performance with several benefits; (i) All active radio links are identified in advance and can be optimally scheduled. Every transmission has a deterministic time-slot, source, destination, and wireless channel; (ii) Any unauthorized transmissions, even a single packet transmission, can be detected quickly and reported to the SDN control-plane for corrective action; (iii) Wireless interference can be minimized by using pre-programmed Directional-Antennas; (iv) Wireless buffer sizes and queueing delays can be reduced to near-minimal values; and (v) Wireless Crosshaul bandwidth requirements can be reduced significantly. Our 5G DRAN can embed thousands of Deterministic Virtual Networks (DVNs) or Deterministic Network Slices, to ensure exceptionally-strong security and privacy between different M2M or D2D systems. The secure 5G DRAN can also integrate seamlessly with a future secure deterministic Industrial-Tactile IoT.},

abstract={The sharing of passive network elements is a common phenomenon in mobile markets. Some regulatory authorities also support active sharing of the radio access network. More far reaching sharing concepts like the virtualisation of network functions up to network slicing are on the way. Given the need for a significant increase in the number of base stations and sites in a 5 G environment it has to be anticipated that the need for sharing network elements between mobile operators will increase significantly over the next few years. Against this background the paper analyses how regulatory authorities can make the relevant balance between economically desirable cost savings, reduction of the impacts on the population and the environment on the one hand side, and competition implications of network cooperation on the other hand side which could be unfavourable, in order to decide on individual forms of operator co-operation and its intensity. The paper starts from a broad definition of network sharing. The classic forms of mobile network sharing relate to the joint use of passive and/or active network elements. This applies in particular to the joint use of access network infrastructures. Joint use of network infrastructure may, but does not have to, include shared use of frequencies. Although in the case of roaming only the (respective) elements of a network are used, this form of co-operation is in the end equivalent to network sharing. Since the network is defined less by the physical hardware, sharing may also refer to software-determined network functions. The most extensive use of a third party network is in the form of a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) relationship.},

abstract={This paper considers the uplink dynamic resource allocation in a cloud radio access network (C-RAN) serving users belonging to different service providers (called slices) to form virtualized wireless networks (VWN). In particular, the C-RAN supports a pool of base-station (BS) baseband units (BBUs), which are connected to BS radio remote heads (RRHs) equipped with massive massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO), via fronthaul links with limited capacity. Assuming that each user can be assigned to a single RRH-BBU pair, we formulate a resource allocation problem aiming to maximize the total system rate, constrained on the minimum rates required by the slices and the maximum number of antennas and power allocated to each user. The effects of pilot contamination error on the VWN performance are investigated and pilot duration is considered as a new optimization variable in resource allocation. This problem is inherently nonconvex, NP-hard and, thus, computationally inefficient. By applying the successive convex approximation and complementary geometric programming approach, we propose a two-step iterative algorithm: one to adjust the RRH, BBU, and fronthaul parameters, and the other for power and antenna allocation to users. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the developed algorithm for VWNs in a massive-MIMO-aided and fronthaul-limited C-RAN, and demonstrate the effects of imperfect channel state information estimation due to pilot contamination error, and the optimal pilot duration.},

However, the advent of vehicular networks with a wide variety of new services and devices changes the existing cellular network landscape, and the cellular-based vehicular networks are confronted with serious challenge in terms of latency reduction and flexible service delivery. In this paper, we propose to deploy the specific server, called Mobile-Edge Computing (MEC) server, within the Radio Access Network, and allow them to connect with a set of base stations alongside roads, so as to provide flexible vehicle-related service and efficiently control the radio network. Then, the vision of MEC- assisted slicing network and a traffic scheduling policy are presented to promote network customization. As an instance of the MEC-based tailored network service, a time-predicted handover mechanism for vehicles is further developed by leveraging available road information and the enhanced capacity of the MEC server to satisfy the demand for high mobility and reliability.},

Thus, it is necessary to remove all the technological bottlenecks and operational rigidities to ensure a painless migration from the existing radio scenario to the 5G one. This article presents a transport architecture able to serve as a backhaul and fronthaul to convey radio traffic on the same optical infrastructure. The cornerstones of the solution are a novel photonic technology used to provide optical connectivity, complemented by a dedicated agnostic framing; a deterministic switching module; and a flexible control paradigm based on a layered scheme and on the slicing concept to facilitate optimal interactions of transport and radio resources while preserving a well-demarcated mutual independence. Simulations and experiments are presented to demonstrate the aforementioned features.},

abstract={Inspired by the success of use of Virtual Machines (VMs) in cloud computing, virtualization has been introduced to wireless networking recently, enabling support for multiple Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) via isolated slices over a shared wireless substrate. In this paper, we present design, implementation and evaluation of a novel cloud framework, R-Cloud, to enable radio resources at Base Stations (BSs) to be effectively allocated to multiple MVNOs as a service, which is referred to as Radio-as-a-Service (RaaS). R-Cloud employs a hybrid two-level control framework to enable coarse-grained and fine-grained resource allocation at the cloud and BS levels respectively. Specifically, R-Cloud not only coordinates resource allocation among BSs, MVNOs and mobile users across a Radio Access Network (RAN) and enables performance isolation by optimizing resource sharing and user association using an LP-rounding based algorithm at the cloud level; but also effectively schedule transmissions among multiple users at a BS using an optimal scheduling policy. We implemented R-Cloud over a wireless network testbed with software defined radios. It has been shown by extensive experimental and simulation results that R-Cloud can achieve effective RaaS over wireless networks and the proposed resource allocation algorithms outperform widely-used baseline solutions.},

In such scenarios, the forecasted MVNO traffic is the basis for providing resources suitable with the corresponding MVNOs demand. To that end, the dynamic provision of resources among MVNOs should be performed in flexible, short-term time scales. In this paper, we effectively address this issue by integrating the capacity broker into the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) network management architecture using the minimum set of enhancements. In addition, to fully exploit its capabilities, we propose the Multi-tenant Slicing (MuSli) of capacity algorithm, to allocate resources towards MVNOs in coarse time scales. MuSli considers the estimated capacity and the impact of the traffic type (i.e., guaranteed QoS and Best-Effort) in each MVNO, to provide better utilization of the host network's capacity. Our results highlight the gains in the number of served requests without compromising their service quality.},

abstract={Network slicing enables mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) to lease network resources from a mobile network operator (MNO). The cloud radio access network (CRAN) architecture reduces the capital and operational expenditures for the MNO and also facilitates MVNOs running virtual machines on the cloud server. In this paper, we propose a beamforming scheme that coordinates multiple remote radio heads (RRHs) in C-RAN to improve the quality of experience (QoE) of users by maximizing their aggregate weighted quality of service (QoS). We model the QoS of each mobile user by a sigmoidal function and formulate the beamforming design as a non-convex optimization problem. By introducing an interference threshold, we first develop an iterative algorithm to determine a suboptimal solution of the original problem. Based on simulation results, we then show that a suitable interference threshold can be obtained in an off-line manner such that the suboptimal solution is a close-to-optimal solution of the original non-convex problem. Simulation results also show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the aggregate weighted QoS of the mobile users compared to the traditional design where the weighted system sum rate is maximized.},

abstract={The ever increasing video demands from mobile users have posed great challenges to cellular networks. To address this issue, video caching in radio access networks (RANs) has been recognized as one of the enabling technologies in future 5G mobile networks, which brings contents near the end-users, reducing the transmission cost of duplicate contents, meanwhile increasing the Quality-of-Experience (QoE) of users. Inspired by the emerging software-defined networking technology, recent proposals have employed centralized collaborative caching among cells to further increase the caching capacity of the RAN. In this paper, we explore a new dimension in video caching in software-defined RANs to expand its capacity. We enable the controller with the capability to adaptively select the bitrates of videos received by users, in order to maximize the number and quality of video requests that can be served, meanwhile minimizing the transmission cost. To achieve this, we further incorporate Scalable Video Coding (SVC), which enables caching and serving sliced video layers that can serve different bitrates. We formulate the problem of joint video caching and scheduling as a reward maximization (cost minimization) problem. Based on the formulation, we further propose a 2-stage rounding-based algorithm to address the problem efficiently. Simulation results show that using SVC with collaborative caching greatly improves the cache capacity and the QoE of users.},

This paper provides an overview of China Mobile's 5G vision and potential solutions. Targeting a paradigm shift to user-centric network operation from the traditional cell-centric operation, 5G radio access network (RAN) design considerations are presented, including RAN restructure, Turbo charged edge, core network (CN) and RAN function repartition, and network slice as a service. Adaptive multiple connections in the user-centric operation is further investigated, where the decoupled downlink and uplink, decoupled control and data, and adaptive multiple connections provide sufficient means to achieve a 5G network with “no more cells.” Software-defined air interface (SDAI) is presented under a unified framework, in which the frame structure, waveform, multiple access, duplex mode, and antenna configuration can be adaptively configured. New paradigm of 5G network featuring user-centric network (UCN) and SDAI is needed to meet the diverse yet extremely stringent requirements across the broad scope of 5G scenarios.},

abstract={Cellular communications are evolving to facilitate the current and expected increasing needs of quality of service, high data rates, and diversity of offered services. Toward this direction, radio access network (RAN) virtualization aims at providing solutions of mapping virtual network elements onto radio resources of the existing physical network. This paper proposes the Resources nEgotiation for NEtwork Virtualization (RENEV) algorithm, which is suitable for application in heterogeneous networks in Long-Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) environments, consisting of a macro evolved Node B overlaid with small cells (SCs). By exploiting radio resource management principles, RENEV achieves slicing and on-demand delivery of resources. Leveraging the multitenancy approach, radio resources are transferred in terms of physical radio resource blocks among multiple heterogeneous base stations, which are interconnected via the X2 interface. The main target is to deal with traffic variations in geographical dimension. All signaling design considerations under the current Third-Generation Partnership Project LTE-A architecture are also investigated. Analytical studies and simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate RENEV in terms of the network's throughput and additional signaling overhead. Moreover, we show that RENEV can be applied independently on top of already proposed schemes for RAN virtualization to improve their performance. The results indicate that significant advantages are achieved both from the network's and users' perspective and that it is a scalable solution for different numbers of SCs.},

It is unthinkable to build such a convergent network without slicing at all levels: from the physical (slicing is enforced by the integration of several radio access technologies) to application levels.

abstract={Recently network slicing has been identified as a promising network architectural technology for the next generation mobile cellular networks (5G) to address the challenges stemming from a wide range of applications. Especially, for machine type communication (MTC) application, it is widely recognized that traditional cellular network architecture is not adequate to meet the requirements in terms of massive connectivity and low latency. For exploiting network slicing, data aggregation (DA) can be adopted to effectively address the massive connectivity and latency requirement. In this paper, we propose an efficient network slicing data aggregation (NSDA) scheme for MTC applications. Different from conventional DA scheme where data aggregation is performed based on device locations, we perform DA according to latency requirement for MTC devices (MTCDs), with aim to exploit the benefits of network slicing and thus improve network access capacity and decrease access latency. We formulate the DA problem as a 0-1 Linear Programming and propose an efficient two-step algorithm to aggregate the MTC data for accessing a specific network slice. We examine the performance of our proposed NSDA in typical MTC scenarios via simulations. Numerical results reveal that NSDA significantly outperforms traditional MTC access schemes (without network slicing) in terms of network capacity, access congestion degree, latency, etc.},

The user scheduling in the contention-free A-phase and determination of p values for the contention-based C-phase along with the user-AP association are formulated as an optimization problem, aiming to maximize the overall network throughput under the slice isolation constraints and channel conditions. Subsequently, complementary geometric programming (CGP) and monomial approximations are used to develop an iterative algorithm for solution. Illustrative simulation results show the efficiency of the developed solution and its effect on network performance while maintaining the isolation among slices.},

abstract={Efficient content caching plays a crucial role in quality of service enhancement and congestion mitigation of the backhaul and core networks for the fifth-generation (5G) wireless network, which must support a large amount of multimedia and video content. Wireless network virtualization provides a novel paradigm shift in 5G system design which enables to better utilize network resources, rapid development of new services, and reduce the operation cost. Harmonized deployment of a content caching strategy in the virtualized wireless network environment, however, requires a suitable radio resource allocation framework to realize the great benefits of these technologies. In this paper, we study the joint resource allocation and content caching problem which aims to efficiently utilize the radio and content storage resources in the highly congested backhaul scenario. In this design, we minimize the maximum content request rejection rate experienced by users of different mobile virtual network operators in different cells, which results in a mixed-integer non-linear program. We solve this difficult optimization problem by proposing a bisection-search-based algorithm that iteratively optimizes the resource allocation and content caching placement. We further propose a low-complexity heuristic algorithm which achieves moderate performance loss compared to the bisection-search based algorithm. Extensive numerical results confirm the efficacy of our proposed framework which significantly reduces the maximum request outage probability compared with other benchmark algorithms.},

abstract={We consider the virtualization technique in the downlink transmission of limited fronthaul capacity cloud-radio access networks (C-RANs). A novel virtual computing resource allocation (VCRA) method which can dynamically split the users workload into smaller fragments to be served by virtual machines is presented. Under the proposed scheme, we aim at maximizing the network energy efficiency by a joint design of virtual computing resources, transmit beamforming, remote radio head (RRH) selection, and RRH-user association. Moreover, we construct a more realistic fronthaul power consumption model, which is directly proportional to users’ rate transmitted by the corresponding RRHs. The formulated problem is combinatorial and difficult to solve in general. Our first contribution is to customize a branch and reduce and bound (BnRnB) method to attain a globally optimal solution. To compute a high-quality approximate solution, a standard routine is used to deal with the continuous relaxation of the original problem. However, the proposed continuous relaxation is non-convex which implies another challenge. For a practically appealing solution approach, we resort to a local optimization method, namely the difference of convex algorithm (DCA). Our second contribution is on the use of Lipschitz continuity to arrive at a sequence of convex quadratic programs, which can be solved efficiently by modern convex solvers. Finally, a post-processing procedure is proposed to obtain a high-performance feasible solution from the continuous relaxation. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms converge rapidly and achieve near-optimal performance as well as outperform other known methods. Moreover, we numerically show that the VCRA scheme significantly improves the system energy efficiency compared to the existing schemes.},

The research is motivated by ongoing struggle to improve indoor coverage, to meet ever increasing capacity demands and to develop 5G access solutions to be ready for future use cases. The framework conceives an indoor small cell deployment for the campus, operated and managed by the uO, which leverages network slicing to provide the campus with local customized service, while at the same time also acting as a neutral host for participating MNOs. The proposed framework will be beneficial in terms of reduced costs, additional revenues, dedicated services, coverage, and spectrum utilization. In the end, the framework is contended to be economically viable and more beneficial than Wi-Fi deployments. The total cost of ownership (TCO) is calculated per access point type and then the TCO for current total capacity is calculated for each option. The analysis shows that although small cells are expensive on a unit basis but the overall network can be cheaper and more beneficial than a Wi-Fi deployment.},

The algorithm allows radio resources from across the whole spectrum to be allocated to users from different slices, so avoiding the inefficiencies of fixed slices. By using game theory, we can apply constraints on the resources allocated to individual users, or users from particular slices, to meet the requirements of the operator. The scenario adopted is a multi-cell OFDMA network and the resource allocation is performed using a non-cooperative game. Simulation results show why such an approach leads to more efficient and fairer networks.},

abstract={MEC or Multi-Access Edge Computing is a network service delivery architecture that enables cloud computing capabilities at the edge of the access network. Realisation of the MEC vision is challenging with current network technologies: service discovery and routing, secure network slicing and distributed mobility management require complex capabilities in the network. This demo features an OMEC use case realised via RINA, the Recursive Network Architecture. RINA provides interesting properties for OMEC, due to its support for multi-homing, mobility and slicing without special protocols, and security as a first class element of the architecture.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a throughput-maximum resource provision scheme in the OFDMA-based Wireless Virtual Network (WVN). The proposed scheme takes the dynamics of both traffic arrivals and wireless channels into consideration. Furthermore, we consider a more flexible service contract where average resource provision is guaranteed for each slice. As it is practically impossible to know future traffic arrival and channel information, we employ the Lyapunov Optimization to develop an online resource provision algorithm. The proposed online algorithm performs joint subcarrier and power allocation to each slice based on the traffic information, wireless channel state as well as historical resource provision. Theoretic analysis implies that the proposed algorithm can arbitrarily get close to the theoretic optimal throughput with degradations in delay, and the two performances can be balanced on demand. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed scheme can significantly improve the average throughput, while reducing the average delay and achieving an excellent isolation performance.},

abstract={The discussion around Network Slicing for 5G Systems is slowly converging to concrete solutions which will be adopted in the early deployment of 5G Networks due by 2020. In particular, within 3GPP standardization body, study items recently completed have finalized the definition of 5G System architecture, comprising Access and Core Networks, and defined the key design principles for End to End Network Slicing. This paper reviews the latest achievements of 3GPP SA2 and RAN3 Working Groups (WGs) in this respect, relating them to the genesis of Network Slicing and to prior 4G technical solutions, which can be considered precursors of the concept. Essentially, this paper timely clarifies how Network Slicing will be brought into real systems, and sheds some light on the necessary next steps to further progress on the topic.},

abstract={Resource allocation and traffic aggregation is becoming a significant part of the network deployment as it is expected that operators will offer advanced services through 5G systems. Scheduling procedures need to be fair but also to handle requirements set for diverse groups of users forming network slices. Heterogeneous networks will need to be controlled locally and the traffic could be split between the macro cell LTE nodes and small cell WiFi distributed access points (APs). In this work, we examine the performance of a novel optimal resource allocation algorithm while adding a new process aiming in achieving predefined throughput and delay performance for selected groups/slices of users. From the optimal resource allocation algorithm, we derive an algorithmic solution which can be applied to determine a number of network slices. The 3GPP-WLAN interworking setup evaluation shows that our proposal can be used for allocating resources to slices of users fulfilling throughput and delay requirements set by their subscription.},

abstract={5G networks are expected to be able to satisfy users' different QoS requirements. Network slicing is a promising technology for 5G networks to provide services tailored for users' specific QoS demands. Driven by the increased massive wireless data traffic from different application scenarios, efficient resource allocation schemes should be exploited to improve the flexibility of network resource allocation and capacity of 5G networks based on network slicing. Due to the diversity of 5G application scenarios, new mobility management schemes are greatly needed to guarantee seamless handover in network-slicing-based 5G systems. In this article, we introduce a logical architecture for network-slicing-based 5G systems, and present a scheme for managing mobility between different access networks, as well as a joint power and subchannel allocation scheme in spectrum-sharing two-tier systems based on network slicing, where both the co-tier interference and cross-tier interference are taken into account. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed resource allocation scheme can flexibly allocate network resources between different slices in 5G systems. Finally, several open issues and challenges in network-slicing-based 5G networks are discussed, including network reconstruction, network slicing management, and cooperation with other 5G technologies.},

abstract={We propose a wireless virtualization framework based on the Stackelberg game model for resource allocation in downlink orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) wireless networks. Specifically, the wireless virtualization model enables an infrastructure provider (InP) to effectively lease radio resources to multiple mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) through adaptively setting resource prices whereas the MVNOs selfishly optimize the resource allocation to maximize their utilities. The Stackelberg game approach is employed to solve the underlying hierarchical problems where the InP acts as a leader while the MVNOs play the roles of the followers. In particular, we derive the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE), at which no player has incentive to deviate unilaterally. Extensive numerical results are presented to confirm the efficacy of our proposed framework in balancing the achievable utilities of the InP and MVNOs compared to other traditional pricing schemes.},

abstract={Nowadays, the usage of multiple virtual wireless networks on top of one physical AP is very common in home Wi-Fi networks. Be it Hotspots of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) used for offloading their traffic, community networks or plain so-called "Guest-Networks". Whereas the home user (AP owner) in the best case should not even be aware that his network connection is shared. Most of the ISPs and MNOs are now trying to convince their customers to install an additional virtual wireless hotspot network on their home AP and offer them in return the free usage of all other available hotspots. But, currently most costumers are skeptical as the providers cannot guarantee a downlink slice of air-time or real separation in time on the wireless access network. In this paper we demonstrate by using a novel downlink slicing scheme applied on commercial off-the-shelf hardware, how slicing on MAC level can be applied to truly guarantee a fixed amount of air-time for the home user and provide complete traffic separation in time between the home and the hotspot network. Moreover, our demonstrator shows the benefits of the approach by comparing the quality of a high definition video stream with and without our MAC slicing approach.},

pages={102-108}, 
abstract={Knowing the variety of services and applications to be supported in the upcoming 5G systems, the current "one size fits all" network architecture is no more efficient. Indeed, each 5G service may have different needs in terms of latency, bandwidth, and reliability, which cannot be sustained by the same physical network infrastructure. In this context, network virtualization represents a viable way to provide a network slice tailored to each service. Several 5G initiatives (from industry and academia) have been pushing for solutions to enable network slicing in mobile networks, mainly based on SDN, NFV, and cloud computing as key enablers. The proposed architectures focus principally on the process of instantiating and deploying network slices, while ignoring how they are enforced in the mobile network. While several techniques of slicing the network infrastructure exist, slicing the RAN is still challenging. In this article, we propose a new framework to enforce network slices, featuring radio resources abstraction. The proposed framework is complementary to the ongoing solutions of network slicing, and fully compliant with the 3GPP vision. Indeed, our contributions are twofold: a fully programmable network slicing architecture based on the 3GPP DCN and a flexible RAN (i.e., programmable RAN) to enforce network slicing; a two-level MAC scheduler to abstract and share the physical resources among slices. Finally, a proof of concept on RAN slicing has been developed on top of OAI to derive key performance results, focusing on the flexibility and dynamicity of the proposed architecture to share the RAN resources among slices.},

abstract={The Frontier Radio for the Solar Probe Plus mission offers a host of hardware design and manufacturing improvements. These improvements build on the technology readiness level (TRL)-9 radio platform that was flown on the Van Allen Probes mission in a duplexed S-band configuration and several development tasks funded by NASA Headquarters. Prior RF slice designs consisted of two separate circuit boards: one for lower frequencies and one for high-frequencies; advances in technology enabled the use of a high-frequency multilayer laminate with highly integrated miniature components to create a single circuit board, thereby simplifying manufacturing. This change also enabled an improved circuit topology in the upconverter in both exciters producing lower phase noise and better I/Q modulation accuracy. RF shielding performance was improved using compartmentalized plates and Spira-Shield gaskets. Use of a magnesium alloy for the slice packaging reduced the overall radio mass. A design-variant approach was implemented to facilitate flexibility and re-configurability across multiple missions and applications. For example, one circuit board artwork supports S, X, and Ka-band configurations of the exciter slice, and the digital signal processing (DSP) slice's board artwork facilitates numerous alternate configurations for a variety of mission applications. Advances made to the DSP slice include dual footprint circuits and an interposer for the field programmable gate array (FPGA) to minimize layout changes, a change to a radiation-hardened magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) to replace the programmable read-only memory (PROM), and new test and debugging circuits including a serializer-deserializer (SERDES), a SpaceWire debug link, and small footprint soft-touch connectors to access internal signals. A multi-chip module (MCM) was qualified for use in space that converts X-band to Ka-band and I/Q modulates directly at Ka-band. This enables a first for a dee- -space mission: primary science data downlink with simultaneous data and navigation over Ka-band. Manufacturing techniques such as the use of a pick-and-place machine with part value validation, standardized circuit board sizes, and fewer overall circuit boards to integrate all contributed to faster and more reliable hardware assembly. The flight radio hardware is fully fabricated and has completed proto-flight testing for a planned 2018 spacecraft launch.},

abstract={Nowadays domestic and enterprise WLANs are pervasive and offer capabilities adequate for a broad spectrum of applications. Unlocking these networks for enhanced wireless access to select users and devices, through dynamically sharing the unused portion of hotspots bandwidth, is key to provide seamless connectivity. Far from providing just basic wireless connectivity, we argue that these WLANs can be efficiently exploited to cope with emerging applications in the context of smart cities, massive machine type communication, and cellular data offloading. We introduce an approach aimed at the efficient sharing of available WLANs resources, allowing applications of domestic or enterprise users to coexist with third-party applications. To achieve this goal, we go beyond existing solutions by proposing the virtualization of access networks to offer differentiated networking services in an isolated manner. However, commodity wireless access devices are low-cost and performance-constrained, in contrast to carrier-grade systems that are very costly by deploying high networking performance. For this paper, we focus on the suitability of our approach on the customer premises, by assessing key performance networking aspects of SDN-enabled commodity wireless access devices, to obtain a better perspective of their current limitations.},

abstract={Nowadays, ISPs witness an increasing network traffic generated by wireless online video services. Facing the intense mutual competition, it is important for an ISP to improve QoE of wireless video services. Since it is difficult for ISPs to collect user experience information at routers and switches, we propose an approach based on ISP traffic monitoring to access the stalling of a video stream, which is the key factor to video QoE. Concretely, we passively sniff out the following parameters to reconstruct video playing and stalling: playback rate of a slice, start-up delay and playback resuming threshold. Our difference from previous works is that we need not intrude into packets to extract HTTP meta information for these parameters. Moreover, we develop a video stalling assessment system based on Apache Storm, which can process the network traffic data in real time. Experiments on popular online video services (Tencent Video, iQiyi and Youku) in China as well as Youtube in US show not bad absolute difference of stalling times and total stalling duration between our traffic monitoring approach and real measurement.},

abstract={The emergence of two new technologies, namely, software defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV), have radically changed the development of network functions and the evolution of network architectures. These two technologies bring to mobile operators the promises of reducing costs, enhancing network flexibility and scalability, and shortening the time-to-market of new applications and services. With the advent of SDN and NFV and their offered benefits, the mobile operators are gradually changing the way how they architect their mobile networks to cope with ever-increasing growth of data traffic, massive number of new devices and network accesses, and to pave the way toward the upcoming fifth generation networking. This survey aims at providing a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art research work, which leverages SDN and NFV into the most recent mobile packet core network architecture, evolved packet core. The research work is categorized into smaller groups according to a proposed four-dimensional taxonomy reflecting the: 1) architectural approach, 2) technology adoption, 3) functional implementation, and 4) deployment strategy. Thereafter, the research work is exhaustively compared based on the proposed taxonomy and some added attributes and criteria. Finally, this survey identifies and discusses some major challenges and open issues, such as scalability and reliability, optimal resource scheduling and allocation, management and orchestration, and network sharing and slicing that raise from the taxonomy and comparison tables that need to be further investigated and explored.},

In this scheme, high-load users with non-empty queues are proper and potential candidates for TDMA, while others can compete using p-persistent CSMA. At each superframe, AP decides on TDMA-CSMA scheduling by taking into account traffic parameters of users and slice reservations to maximize the network utilization, while maintaining slice isolation. The corresponding optimization problem is formulated to dynamically schedule users for TDMA phase and optimally pick p parameter for remaining CSMA users. Using complementary geometric programming (CGP) and monomial approximations, an iterative algorithm is developed to find the optimal solution.

abstract={In this paper, we apply the concept of a software-defined data plane to defining new services for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) to empower them with the capability of tailoring fine-grained subscription plans that can meet users' demands. For this purpose, we have recently proposed the concept of application-and/ or device-specific slicing that classifies application-and/or device-specific traffic into slices and introduced various applications of our proposed system [Optical Fiber Communication Conf. (OFC), 2016, paper Th3I.4]. This paper reports the prototype implementation of the proposal into a real MVNO connecting customized smartphones so we can identify applications/devices from the given traffic with 100% accuracy. We first characterize the traffic patterns of popular applications to build a detailed understanding of how network resources are utilized for real users and applications and what their demands on different network resources are. Then, we classify traffic according to the devices and find that the flow characteristics of LTE RAN slices are very similar to those of 3G. We discover that most of the bandwidth is consumed by those flows with the duration of several hundreds of seconds, and the flow size is larger than 5 Mbytes in both LTE and 3G MVNO networks.},

abstract={Wireless virtualization is a promising approach to foster innovation and prevent the ossification of wireless networks. Within a virtualized wireless network, multiple network slices, or virtual operators (VO), are co- hosted on the same physical infrastructure. A fundamental question in this environment is which multiplexing technique, TDMA, FDMA or SDMA, should be used to slice the network among the VOs. Another related question is how should the stochastic arrival process affect the slicing and QoS criteria. To answer these two questions, we study the problem of QoS-aware joint admission control and network slicing. Due to the NP- hardness of the problem, we approach it using a heuristic algorithm composed of three steps: spectrum allocation, admission control and spatial multiplexing. The proposed algorithm incorporates the effects of QoS and stochastic traffic. We study through simulations the benefits of joint spatial- frequency multiplexing over the static frequency slicing approach. Finally, our simulation results help shed some light on the trade-offs between frequency and spatial multiplexing as well as between QoS and utilization.},

abstract={In this paper, we address a power-efficient resource allocation problem in virtualized wireless networks (VWNs) using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). In this set-up, the resources of one base station (BS) are shared among different service providers (slices), where the minimum reserved rate is considered for each slice for guaranteeing their isolation. The formulated resource allocation problem aiming to minimize the total transmit power subject to the isolation constraints is non-convex and suffers from high computational complexity. By applying complementary geometric programming (CGP) to convert the non-convex problem into the convex form, we develop an efficient iterative approach with low computational complexity to solve the proposed problem. Illustrative simulation results on the performance evaluation of VWN using OFDMA and NOMA indicate significant performance improvement in the VWN when NOMA is used.},

abstract={Communication and networking research introduces new protocols and standards with an increasing number of researchers relying on real experiments rather than simulations to evaluate the performance of their new protocols. A number of testbeds are currently available for this purpose and a growing number of users are requesting access to those testbeds. This motivates the need for better utilization of the testbeds by allowing concurrent experimentations. In this work, we introduce a novel mapping algorithm that aims to maximize wireless testbed utilization using frequency slicing of the spectrum resources. The mapper employs genetic algorithm to find the best combination of requests that can be served concurrently, after getting all possible mappings of each request via an induced sub-graph isomorphism stage. The proposed mapper is tested on grid testbeds and randomly generated topologies. The solution of our mapper is compared to the optimal one, obtained through a brute-force search, and was able to serve the same number of requests in 82.96% of testing scenarios. Furthermore, we show the effect of the careful design of testbed topology on enhancing the testbed utilization by applying our mapper on a carefully positioned 8-nodes testbed. In addition, our proposed approach for testbed slicing and requests mapping has shown an improved performance in terms of total served requests, about five folds, compared to the simple allocation policy with no slicing.},

abstract={New technologies and architectures arise in the telecommunications industry in order to cater to the ever growing demands in terms of resource utilization, manageability and user experience. C-RAN and SDN represent two such novel paradigms, both advocating for centralization of a set of resources or control capabilities respectively. The C-RAN architecture requires a significant amount of link capacity which may be a prohibitive factor in its adoption hence an obvious solution is to intelligently share the physical infrastructure among several virtual operators. In this context, a new challenge is to flexibly manage the sharing of the infrastructure. This paper argues that a centralized, SDN-based approach can bring the needed flexibility in the management of the C-RAN. More specifically, this paper proposes a policy-centric management framework, which uses the SDN architecture to enforce various rules for sharing the physical infrastructure. A testbed based on Floodlight and Mininet has been implemented to show the benefits of using this automatic management tool for sharing the mobile site capacity.},

abstract={Channel handoff is a crucial function for Cognitive radio ad hoc networks (CRAHNs). The absence of centralized infrastructures and the limited power make the handoff design more challenging. A learning-based interference-aware handoff scheme is proposed for distributed CRAHNs. We model the channel handoff process as a Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and adopt a Q-learning algorithm to find an optimal handoff strategy in a long term. The proposed algorithm obtains an efficient transmission performance by considering the interferences among SUs and PUs. To achieve PU awareness, the handoff scheme predicts the PU activities by using the historical channel usage statistics. In addition, we also propose a refined channel selection rule to compromise between learning speed and cumulative transmission reward. The simulation results show that the proposed handoff scheme can adapt to the PU activities and achieves a better performance in terms of high throughput and low collisions. And the learning process keeps a considerable balance between convergence time and cumulative reward.},

abstract={In cognitive radio networks, secondary users (SUs) can access the spectrum licensed by primary users (PUs) in an opportunistic fashion provided they cause no harmful interference to primary transmissions. Assuming that selfish and malicious but rational types of SUs are present in the network, we consider a setting where the PUs can also benefit from the cooperation with the SUs. The SUs are autonomous agents, have disparate interests and aim at maximizing their own type-dependent interests. Since misbehaving users can impede the PUs' communications by malicious or selfish actions, we develop a trust management scheme employed by the PUs that rewards cooperative SUs and punishes non-cooperative ones. We study the impact of trust on both types of misbehaving SUs' optimal decision-making process, by utilizing the Markov Decision Process framework, and we derive conditions that provably thwart malicious and selfish behavior for certain model parameters.},

abstract={We introduce competing cognitive resilient network (CCRN) of mobile radios challenged to optimize data throughput and networking efficiency under dynamic spectrum access and adversarial threats (e.g., jamming). Unlike the conventional approaches, CCRN features both communicator and jamming nodes in a friendly coalition to take joint actions against hostile networking entities. In particular, this paper showcases hypothetical blue force and red force CCRNs and their competition for open spectrum resources. We present state-agnostic and stateful solution approaches based on the decision theoretic framework. The state-agnostic approach builds on multiarmed bandit to develop an optimal strategy that enables the exploratory-exploitative actions from sequential sampling of channel rewards. The stateful approach makes an explicit model of states and actions from an underlying Markov decision process and uses multiagent Q-learning to compute optimal node actions. We provide a theoretical framework for CCRN and propose new algorithms for both approaches. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithms outperform some of the most important algorithms known to date.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate a security mode decision policy for a cognitive radio network (CRN) powered by a non-radio frequency energy harvester. In such a network, a cognitive user (CU), which has a finite battery capacity, senses the presence of the primary user and tries to access the time-slotted primary channel opportunistically to transmit data. However, communication can be vulnerable to sudden attacks that are carried out by hidden eavesdroppers. Therefore, we propose an energy-efficient data encryption scheme for CRNs to increase the effective security level under energy limitation constraints. The operation mode decision policy is formulated as a framework of a partially observable Markov decision process. In this approach, based on the sensing results and the remaining energy at the beginning of each time slot, CUs can decide to stay silent to save energy, or become active and encrypt data using opportune private-key encryption methods considering the effect of the current action on the future reward to maximize the effective security. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme by using numerical simulation results.},

abstract={Cognitive networks (CNs) are one of the key enablers for the Internet of Things (IoT), where CNs will play an important role in the future internet in several application scenarios, such as healthcare, agriculture, environment monitoring, and smart metering. However, the current low packet transmission efficiency of IoT faces a problem of the crowded spectrum for the rapidly increasing popularities of various wireless applications. Hence, the IoT that uses the advantages of cognitive technology, namely the cognitive radio-based Internet of Things (CIoT), is a promising solution for IoT applications. A major challenge in CIoT is the packet transmission efficiency using CNs. Therefore, a new Q-learning-based transmission scheduling mechanism using deep learning for the CIoT is proposed to solve the problem of how to achieve the appropriate strategy to transmit packets of different buffers through multiple channels to maximize the system throughput. A Markov decision process based model is formulated to describe the state transformation of the system. A relay is used to transmit packets to the sink for the other nodes. To maximize the system utility in different system states, the reinforcement learning method, i.e., the Q learning algorithm, is introduced to help the relay to find the optimal strategy. In addition, the stacked auto-encoders deep learning model is used to establish the mapping between the state and the action to accelerate the solution of the problem. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the new action selection method can converge after a certain number of iterations. Compared with other algorithms, the proposed method can better transmit packets with less power consumption and packet loss.},

In traditional cognitive radio (CR) network, a secondary user (SU) performs spectrum sensing at the start of each time slot, which may waste energy and the transmission opportunities for the SU. In order to improve the SE and EE, a CR network using energy harvesting techniques is considered. A partially observable Markov decision process (MDP) framework and an MDP framework are used to determine the optimal spectrum sensing energy, the transmit energy and spectrum sensing interval to maximize the long-term average weighed sum of the throughput of the SU and the interference caused to the PU. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly increase the average throughput of the SU and EE compared with the traditional spectrum scheme, at the cost of the small but tolerable interference caused to the PU.},

year={2017},

pages={330-345}, 
abstract={Agents in networks often encounter circumstances requiring them to make decisions. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the decisions may be uncertain due to the unknown system state and the uncontrollable externality. The uncertainty can be eliminated through learning from information sources, such as user-generated contents or revealed actions. Nevertheless, the user-generated contents could be untrustworthy since other agents may maliciously create misleading contents for their selfish interests. The passively revealed actions are potentially more trustworthy and also easier to be gathered through simple observations. In this paper, we propose a new stochastic game-theoretic framework, Hidden Chinese Restaurant Game (H-CRG), to utilize the passively revealed actions in stochastic social learning process. We propose grand information extraction, a novel Bayesian belief extraction process, to extract the belief on the hidden information directly from the observed actions. We utilize the coupling relation between belief and policy to transform the original continuous belief-state Markov decision process (MDP) into a discrete-state MDP. The optimal policy is then analyzed in both centralized and game-theoretic approaches. We demonstrate how the proposed H-CRG can be applied to the channel access problem in cognitive radio networks. We then conduct data-driven simulations using the CRAWDAD Dartmouth campus wireless local area network (WLAN) trace. The simulation results show that the equilibrium strategy derived in H-CRG provides higher expected utilities for new users and maintains a reasonable high social welfare comparing with other candidate strategies.},

pages={26-36}, 
abstract={In cognitive radio network (CRN), the secondary user (SU) opportunistically access the wireless channels whenever they are free from the licensed/primary user (PU). Even after occupying the channel, the SU has to sense the channel intermittently to detect reappearance of PU, so that it can stop its transmission and avoid interference to PU. Frequent channel sensing results in the degradation of SU’s throughput whereas sparse sensing increases the interference experienced by the PU. Thus, optimal sensing interval policy plays a vital role in CRN. In the literature, optimal channel sensing strategy has been analyzed for the case when the ON-OFF time distributions of PU are exponential. However, the analysis of recent spectrum measurement traces reveals that PU exhibits heavy-tailed idle times which can be approximated well with hyper-exponential distribution (HED). In this paper, we deduce the structure of optimal sensing interval policy for channels with HED OFF times through Markov decision process. We then use dynamic programming framework to derive suboptimal sensing interval policies. A new multishot sensing interval policy is proposed and it is compared with existing policies for its performance in terms of number of channel sensing and interference to PU.},

abstract={Herein, the authors consider harvested energy powered cognitive radio networks (CRNs) in which harvested energy is stored in a rechargeable battery which has finite capacity. In addition, a practical scenario in which the amount of harvested power is finite is taken into account. Cognitive users (CUs) opportunistically access a licensed channel (or primary channel); meanwhile, it should be ensured that their confidential communications are not leaked to an eavesdropper. We investigate an optimal spectrum sensing schedule and the optimal amount of transmission energy for the CUs in each processing time slot. In particular, at the beginning of each time slot, based on the remaining energy in the battery, CU transmitter decides either: 1) to be active to sense the channel and transmit its data if the channel is found vacant or 2) to stay inactive during the current time slot in order to save energy and wait for more incoming energy for use in the next time slots. The decision is based on expected secrecy transmission rate calculated for both cases over subsequent K time slots. The proposed scheme aims to improve long-term secrecy transmission rate of CRNs in comparison with a conventional scheme where the decision for the current time slot is made to maximize current secrecy transmission rate without considering any future reward.},

abstract={With growing real-time traffic and limited spectrum resources, the communication system must adopt reliable and efficient spectrum sharing techniques for providing improved services to end users. Cooperative cognitive radio network (CCRN) offers a promising solution based on the principle of cooperative diversity where primary users offer transmission opportunities to secondary users in exchange for their relay services. However, existing CCRN models ignore the overhead of cooperation formation and the potential interference introduced by secondary users' transmissions. This may hurt successful packet delivery, and therefore, they cannot be applied to real-time systems. In this paper, we propose an interference aware reliable communication system for real-time applications exploiting the flexibility of a cooperative cognitive network. We formulate the communication system as a Markov decision process and quantify the impact of cooperation overhead and secondary interference on successful packet delivery through its actions and reward functions. We present a distributed algorithm for use in a realistic multi-user setting where a user applies the algorithm to determine cooperation gain, select cooperation pairs, and schedule cooperative transmissions. The simulation results show that the proposed model improves packet reception rate with low cooperation overhead compared to an existing cooperation model.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the transmission strategy for cognitive radios (CRs), which opportunistically operate on various primary users' channels with the aid of proactive spectrum handoff. In particular, a secondary user (SU) in the CR network proactively predicts the future spectrum status and decides whether to keep idle, or stay in the current channel, or switch to a new channel to resume its transmission. A problem of completing a target data packet size of V bits within a predefined deadline D time slots is formulated as a discrete-time Markov decision process, in which the SU aims at minimizing its expected total cost, i.e., transmission cost, handoff cost, and overtime penalty. We solve the problem using dynamic programming, and propose a general optimal transmission with the proactive spectrum handoff (OTPH) algorithm whose complexity is 2 x |V| x D. Furthermore, we prove that for a convex penalty function, the optimal handoff-aided transmission exhibits a threshold structure. A monotone OTPH algorithm with a complexity of max(|V |, D) is used in this case. Simulation results verify that our proposed scheme achieves both the minimal total cost and the highest data transmission efficiency as compared with the traditional always staying and always changing schemes.},

volume={24},

pages={2954-2968}, 
abstract={We are motivated by the need, in some applications, for impromptu or as-you-go deployment of wireless sensor networks. A person walks along a line, starting from a sink node (e.g., a base-station), and proceeds towards a source node (e.g., a sensor) which is at an a priori unknown location. At equally spaced locations, he makes link quality measurements to the previous relay, and deploys relays at some of these locations, with the aim to connect the source to the sink by a multihop wireless path. In this paper, we consider two approaches for impromptu deployment: (i) the deployment agent can only move forward (which we call a pure as-you-go approach), and (ii) the deployment agent can make measurements over several consecutive steps before selecting a placement location among them (the explore-forward approach). We consider a very light traffic regime, and formulate the problem as a Markov decision process, where the trade-off is among the power used by the nodes, the outage probabilities in the links, and the number of relays placed per unit distance. We obtain the structures of the optimal policies for the pure as-you-go approach as well as for the explore-forward approach. We also consider natural heuristic algorithms, for comparison. Numerical examples show that the explore-forward approach significantly outperforms the pure as-you-go approach in terms of network cost. Next, we propose two learning algorithms for the explore-forward approach, based on Stochastic Approximation, which asymptotically converge to the set of optimal policies, without using any knowledge of the radio propagation model. We demonstrate numerically that the learning algorithms can converge (as deployment progresses) to the set of optimal policies reasonably fast and, hence, can be practical model-free algorithms for deployment over large regions. Finally, we demonstrate the end-to-end traffic carrying capability of such networks via field deployment.},

abstract={The problem of distributed and dynamic sensing user selection in cognitive systems is studied in this paper, where channel sensing consumes resources and users behavior is distributed. Since users can obtain the channel state from the fusion center, if there are other users sensing the channel, users may enjoy the results sensed by others rather than sense the channel themselves. Such selfish behavior decreases both network utility and individual rewards. Inspired by the social expectation that no one should always enjoy the fruits of others' labor and that one should provide compensation after obtaining a benefit, we propose a distributed sensing compensation algorithm in this paper. The main concept of this algorithm is that after a channel is accessed successfully, users must sense the channel as a compensation for enjoying others' sensing results. The system state probabilities are obtained using Markov chain analysis. We show that there are always an optimal or near optimal number of users sensing the channel and hence, the near-optimal performance is achieved on average using the proposed algorithm. Additionally, the algorithm achieves good fairness performance with respect to the sensing cost. It is further shown that the proposed algorithm is not only suitable for static scenarios but also adaptable for dynamic scenarios with a changing active user set.},

abstract={This paper presents the problem of optimizing Radio Access Technology (RAT) selection and traffic offloading in a Multi RAT Heterogeneous Network composed by cellular and WiFi networks. The main idea is to distribute the traffic load of the system over the available access networks, while making an efficient use of the radio resources in the long-term. In this sense, a higher and fair WiFi resource utilization is pursued in comparison to cellular network usage. The goal is to avoid an overloaded cellular network scenario and to obtain a decrease in the energy consumption. The problem is modeled as a sequential decision-making process using Semi Markovian Decision Process, where the optimization problem aims at maximizing the total long-term discounted-reward of the network. Value Iteration algorithm is then used to solve the maximization problem and to obtain the optimal policy. From the resulting policy, several performance metrics are derived to evaluate its performance. Numerical results indicate that the proposed RAT selection strategy performs well for distributing the traffic load in a fair manner among WiFi networks while a lower cellular utilization is achieved.},

abstract={With the growing number of connected devices (e.g. smartphones, sensors, actuators and cameras) in 5G, the massive Internet of Thing (IoT) is expected to address a wide range of characteristics and demands, with more radio-frequency (RF) bands to support multiple frequency transmission by 2020. Separate antennas and RF chips may be required for widely separated frequency bands. The development of cognitive radio systems focused on channel access and spectrum sensing, which can be programmed and configured dynamically, is therefore fundamental for the successful deployment of such systems. This paper introduces an innovative system for spectrum sensing, channel access and power for energy constrained wireless sensor networks. A commercially available evaluation board is used to detect and convert RF signals to a DC voltage for powering a sensor board that communicates over other channels to an access point. Our spectrum sensing conceptualizes the Markovian formulation of the exploration/exploitation balancing technique of available frequency bands, also known as the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem. To optimize RF energy harvesting and data transmission in channels modeled by a Rayleigh distribution, we formulate and solve a joint reward equation for the MAB Gittins indices, then compare with another MAB algorithm. The simulation results show the optimality of the Gittins index allocation strategy in terms of channel selection percentage and minimization of the regret.},

abstract={We consider a multi-channel communication system in which a transmitter has access to M channels, but does not know the state of any of the channels. We model the channel state using an ON/OFF Markov process, and allow the transmitter to probe a single channel at predetermined probing intervals to decide over which channel to transmit. For models in which the transmitter must transmit over the probed channel, it has been shown that a myopic policy probing the channel most likely to be ON is optimal. In this paper, we allow the transmitter to select a channel over which to transmit that is potentially different from the probed channel. For a system of two channels, we show that the choice of which channel to probe does not affect the throughput. For a system with many channels, we show that a probing policy that probes the channel that is the second-most likely to be ON results in higher throughput. We extend the channel probing problem to dynamically choose when to probe based on probing history, and characterize the optimal probing policy for various scenarios.},

Different levels of uncertainty are considered for the channel availability under SATCOM delays and jamming effects. Spectrum uncertainty is quantified regarding the parameter estimation for Markov model of spectrum occupancy and the prediction of future channel states under SATCOM delays. Based on these uncertainty models, the optimal spectrum sensing approach is used to identify available channels. Both offline and online algorithms are used for DSA. Offline algorithm first learns spectrum dynamics and then applies DSA, whereas online learning repeats this process and adapts to fast spectrum dynamics. Results show performance gains of DSA over the case without considering spectrum uncertainty.},

abstract={Random linear network coding (RLNC) has been shown to efficiently improve the network performance in terms of reducing transmission delays and increasing the throughput in broadcast and multicast communications. However, it can result in increased storage and computational complexity at the receivers end. In our previous work we considered the broadcast transmission of large file to N receivers. We showed that the storage and complexity requirements at the receivers end can be greatly reduced when segmenting the file into smaller blocks and applying RLNC to these blocks. To that purpose, we proposed a packet scheduling policy, namely the Least Received. In this work we will prove the optimality of our previously proposed policy, in terms of file transfer completion time, when N = 2. We will model our system as a Markov Decision Process and prove the optimality of the policy using Dynamic Programming. Our intuition points that the Least Received policy may be optimal regardless of the number of receivers. Towards that end, we will provide experimental results that agree with this intuition.},

abstract={Motivated by the recent developments in wireless power transfer, we study communication with a remotely powered transmitter. We propose an information-theoretic model where a charger can dynamically decide on how much power to transfer to the transmitter based on its side information regarding the communication, while the transmitter needs to dynamically adapt its coding strategy to its instantaneous energy state, which in turn depends on the actions previously taken by the charger. We characterize the capacity as an n-letter mutual information rate under various levels of side information available at the charger. When the charger is finely tunable to different energy levels, referred to as a “precision charger,” we show that these expressions reduce to single-letter form and there is a simple and intuitive joint charging and coding scheme achieving capacity. The precision charger scenario is motivated by the observation that in practice the transferred energy can be controlled by simply changing the amplitude of the beamformed signal. When the charger does not have sufficient precision, for example, when it is restricted to use a few discrete energy levels, we show that the computation of the n-letter capacity can be cast as a Markov decision process if the channel is noiseless. This allows us to numerically compute the capacity for specific cases and obtain insights on the corresponding optimal policy, or even to obtain closed-form analytical solutions by solving the corresponding Bellman equations, as we demonstrate through examples. Our findings provide some surprising insights on how side information at the charger can be used to increase the overall capacity of the system.},

abstract={Dynamic planning has been used by network operators for energy saving by switching ON-OFF base stations (BSs) according to the traffic load condition while providing quality-of-service (QoS) guarantee for mobile users. In the literature, research efforts focus mainly on satisfying the QoS of downlink mobile users. However, the impact of dynamic planning on the QoS of uplink mobile users is overlooked. A dynamic planning approach that relies only on the downlink performance of mobile users to determine the BS switching decision can result in deactivating nearby small cells and associating uplink mobile users to a faraway macro BS. Consequently, uplink mobile users may suffer from QoS degradation due to the longer transmission distance. Hence, while saving energy for the network operators and satisfying the downlink QoS, the uplink QoS could be violated. In this paper, we propose a balanced dynamic planning approach that accounts for QoS requirements both in the uplink and downlink to specify the BS switching decision. The switching decision is formulated as a two-timescale average reward Markov decision process with finite horizon. Due to computational complexity, sub-optimal algorithms are proposed. Simulation results demonstrate the trade-off between energy saving and QoS guarantee.},

abstract={In reactive cognitive networks, the channel access and the transmission decisions of the cognitive terminals have a long-term effect on the network dynamics. When multiple cognitive terminals coexist, the optimization and implementation of their strategy is challenging and may require considerable coordination overhead. In this paper, such challenge is addressed by a novel framework for the distributed optimization of transmission and channel access strategies. The objective of the cognitive terminals is to find the optimal action distribution depending on the current network state. To reduce the coordination overhead, in the proposed framework the cognitive terminals distributively coordinate the policy, whereas the action in each individual time slot is independently selected by the terminals. The optimization of the transmission and channel access strategy is performed iteratively by using the alternate convex optimization technique, where at each iteration a cognitive terminal is selected to optimize its own action distribution while assuming fixed those of the other cognitive terminals. For a traditional primary-secondary user network configuration, numerical results show that the proposed algorithm converges to a stable solution in a small number of iterations, and a limited performance loss with respect to the perfect coordinated case.},

abstract={With rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), various machine-to-machine communications technologies have emerged in recent years to provide ubiquitous wireless connections for a massive number of IoT devices. This poses significant challenges to network control and management of large-scale IoT networks. Software-defined networking (SDN) is considered a promising technology to streamline network management due to dynamic reconfigurable network elements. Thus, the integration of SDN and IoT provides a potentially feasible solution to strengthening management and control capabilities of the IoT network. Benefit from the SDN technology, resource utilization in the IoT network can be further enhanced. In this paper, we first propose a software-defined network architecture for IoT. Then, the resource allocation problem in the proposed SDN-based IoT network is investigated. The optimal problem of maximizing the expected average rewards of the network is formulated as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP). The optimal solution is obtained through solving the SMDP problem using a relative value iteration algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed resource allocation scheme is able to improve the system rewards compared with other comparative resource allocation schemes.},

abstract={An optimal multi-slot channel sensing schedule is proposed in this study that considers an opportunistic spectrum access with the awareness of channel switching delay and imperfect sensing. A practical case is considered where channel availability statistics are usually correlated in time slots and in frequency channels. The switching delays between channels, hardware constraints, and collision with other cognitive users are considered to find an optimal sensing order of the channels that maximises throughput of cognitive user. The optimal sensing order is obtained using the partially observable Markov decision process framework. Throughput of cognitive user, with and without channel sensing errors, is analytically derived and for each case an algorithm is developed. The proposed scheme mitigates the effect of channel sensing errors on the throughput. Performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through simulations by comparing it with the existing schemes in the literature.},

abstract={In Part I of this paper (“Delay-Optimal Dynamic Mode Selection and Resource Allocation in Device-to-Device Communications-Part I: Optimal Policy”), we investigated dynamic mode selection and subchannel allocation for an orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) cellular network with device-to-device (D2D) communications to minimize the average end-to-end delay performance under the dropping probability constraint. We formulated the optimal resource control problem into an infinite-horizon average-reward constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), and the optimal control policy derived in Part I using the brute-force offline value iteration algorithm based on the reduced-state equivalent Bellman equation still faces the well-known curse-of-dimensionality problem, which limits its practical application in realistic scenarios with multiple D2D users and cellular users. In Part II of this paper, we use linear value approximation techniques to further reduce the state space. Moreover, an online stochastic learning algorithm with two timescales is applied to update the value functions and Lagrangian multipliers (LMs) based on the real-time observations of channel state information (CSI) and queue state information (QSI). The combined online stochastic learning solution converges almost surely to a global optimal solution under some realistic conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves nearly the same performance as the offline value iteration algorithm and outperforms the conventional CSI-only scheme and throughput-optimal scheme in a stability sense.},

abstract={In a spectrally congested environment or a spectrally contested environment which often occurs in cyber security applications, multiple signals are often mixed together with significant overlap in spectrum. This makes the signal detection and parameter estimation task very challenging. In our previous work, we have demonstrated the feasibility of using a second order spectrum correlation function (SCF) cyclostationary feature to perform mixed signal detection and parameter estimation. In this paper, we present our recent work on software defined radio (SDR) based implementation and demonstration of such mixed signal detection algorithms. Specifically, we have developed a software defined radio based mixed RF signal generator to generate mixed RF signals in real time. A graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed to allow users to conveniently adjust the number of mixed RF signal components, the amplitude, initial time delay, initial phase offset, carrier frequency, symbol rate, modulation type, and pulse shaping filter of each RF signal component. This SDR based mixed RF signal generator is used to transmit desirable mixed RF signals to test the effectiveness of our developed algorithms. Next, we have developed a software defined radio based mixed RF signal detector to perform the mixed RF signal detection. Similarly, a GUI has been developed to allow users to easily adjust the center frequency and bandwidth of band of interest, perform time domain analysis, frequency domain analysis, and cyclostationary domain analysis.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider a cognitive setting under the context of cooperative communications, where the cognitive radio (CR) user is assumed to be a self-organized relay for the network. The CR user and the primary user (PU) are assumed to be energy harvesters. The CR user cooperatively relays some of the undelivered packets of the PU. Specifically, the CR user stores a fraction of the undelivered primary packets in a relaying queue (buffer). It manages the flow of the undelivered primary packets to its relaying queue using the appropriate actions over time slots. Moreover, it has the decision of choosing the used queue for channel accessing at idle time slots (slots where the PU's queue is empty). It is assumed that one data packet transmission dissipates one energy packet. The optimal policy changes according to the primary and CR users arrival rates to the data and energy queues as well as the channels connectivity. The CR user saves energy for the PU by taking the responsibility of relaying the undelivered primary packets. It optimally organizes its own energy packets to maximize its payoff as time progresses.},

abstract={In cognitive multimedia mesh networks (CMMNs), unlicensed users (secondary users, SUs) can share the spectrum with licensed users (primary users, PUs) on a non-interfering basis. The main challenge in CMMN is how to implement an efficient optimal control policy that can allocate spectrum and transmission powers for the SUs efficiently and how to adapt these resources to the changing network conditions. The power management scheme should control the SUs powers in such a way that their data communication rate is not affected. SUs power cannot be dropped indefinitely but it should be bounded such that the quality of service (QoS) for the SUs is still supported. Our objective is to serve the maximum number of users and support their QoS while protecting the PUs' rights of using the spectrum exclusively. Due to the direct relationship between the data rate and the quality of the communication channel, we propose a new spectrum allocation scheme that exploits the physical properties of the channel to achieve better performance. In addition to consider QoS for users, our scheme uses several heuristics for selecting channels that meet users requirements. These heuristics include channel error rates, PUs activities, channel capacity and channel adaptation time. Performance evaluation of the proposed scheme shows that the scheme is able to support additional SUs traffic while still ensuring PUs QoS.},

abstract={One of the major design issues in heterogeneous wireless networks is the support of seamless vertical handover for mobile users. The cognitive capability for mobile terminal enables the functionalities of system parameter estimation and learning. By utilizing these parameters, cognitive users make a handover decision to select an appropriate point of attachment (PoA) among multiple primary radio access technologies/networks without explicit negotiation with surrounding PoAs, and thus handover latency and signaling overhead are minimized. A novel cognitive vertical handover process is proposed including system capacity estimation mechanisms and vertical handover decision process. The vertical handover decision problem is formulated as a Markov decision process and its performance is better than other distributed schemes which do not consider the network side's information from the numerical results.},

abstract={We consider the problem of distributed online learning with multiple players in multiarmed bandit (MAB) models. Each player can pick among multiple arms. When a player picks an arm, it gets a reward. We consider both independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) reward model and Markovian reward model. In the i.i.d. model, each arm is modeled as an i.i.d. process with an unknown distribution with an unknown mean. In the Markovian model, each arm is modeled as a finite, irreducible, aperiodic and reversible Markov chain with an unknown probability transition matrix and stationary distribution. The arms give different rewards to different players. If two players pick the same arm, there is a collision, and neither of them get any reward. There is no dedicated control channel for coordination or communication among the players. Any other communication between the users is costly and will add to the regret. We propose an online index-based distributed learning policy called dUCB4 algorithm that trades off exploration versus exploitation in the right way, and achieves expected regret that grows at most as near- O(log2T). The motivation comes from opportunistic spectrum access by multiple secondary users in cognitive radio networks wherein they must pick among various wireless channels that look different to different users. This is the first distributed learning algorithm for multiplayer MABs with heterogeneous players (that have player-dependent rewards) to the best of our knowledge.},

abstract={This paper aims to contribute to bridge the gap between existing theoretical results in distributed radio resource allocation policies based on equilibria in games (assuming complete information and rational players) and practical design of signal processing algorithms for self-configuring wireless networks. For this purpose, the framework of learning theory in games is exploited. Here, a new learning algorithm based on mild information assumptions at the transmitters is presented. This algorithm possesses attractive convergence properties not available for standard reinforcement learning algorithms and in addition, it allows each transmitter to learn both its optimal strategy and the values of its expected utility for all its actions. A detailed convergence analysis is conducted. In particular, a framework for studying heterogeneous wireless networks where transmitters do not learn at the same rate is provided. The proposed algorithm, which can be applied to any wireless network verifying the information assumptions stated, is applied to the case of multiple access channels in order to provide some numerical results.},

abstract={The Next generation wireless system will be heterogeneously made up of multiple radio access networks (RANs) with the different radio access technologies (RATs) as well as subscribers will be equipped with multi-mode, reconfigurable and cognitive equipments, with or without the multi-homing ability. A dynamic resource management mechanism is presented in this paper under the IEEE P1900.4 architecture framework using network utility maximization technologies. This will provide an effective solution for heterogeneous networks to achieve efficient utilization of the various resources, e.g., the radio, the network, the device and the computing resource. Take the end-to-end and overall network performance into account, a double-cycle learning structures based on the utility theory for the terminal and the RAN are proposed, respectively. With the aid of the radio enablers as the interface, the strategy and context information interaction between the terminal and the RAN are investigated. Also, base on the double-cycle learning framework, the interactive protocol between the terminal with RAN and dynamic RAN selection algorithm for the terminal are proposed. Meanwhile, we consider a simple heterogenous scenario to verify the effectiveness of the proposed utility based double cycle learning architecture and the presented algorithms as well as the interactive protocol.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks are believed to be the enabling technology for Ambient Intelligence. They hold the promise of delivering to a smart communication paradigm which enables setting up an intelligent network capable of handling applications that evolve from user requirements. Cognitive agents capable of making proactive decisions based on learning, reasoning and information sharing when interspersed in sensor networks, may help achieve end-to-end goals of the network even in the presence of multiple constraints and optimization objectives. Cognitive radio at the physical layer of such agents may enable the opportunistic use of the heterogeneous wireless environment. However, research efforts have been discrete and cognitive techniques have focused on improving specific aspects of the network or benefiting specific applications. The main contribution of this paper is providing the vision and advantage of a holistic approach to cognition in sensor networks, which can be achieved by incorporating learning and reasoning in the upper layers, and opportunistic spectrum access at the physical layer. Rather than providing an ostensive survey of cognitive architectures applicable to sensor networks, this paper provides the reader with a framework based on knowledge and cognition that can help achieve end-to-end goals of application-specific sensor networks.},

abstract={The coexistence of different heterogeneous Radio Access Technologies (RATs) is a significant feature of current wireless networks. Thus, it is important for network elements, such as the Base Stations (BSs) of cellular networks or access points (APs) of wireless local area networks (WLANs) to be reconfigurable according to the real-time network environment. This will enable interconnection between different networks. In this paper, we propose an efficient distributed reconfiguration algorithm: the Dynamic Network Self-optimization Algorithm (DNSA). This algorithm is based on the widely used Q-learning algorithm and regards the network self-optimization entity of each radio access network as an independent intelligent agent. Multiple agents perform the optimization cooperatively to reduce the system blocking rate and improve network revenue. In the proposed algorithm, the dynamic network self-optimization problem is transformed into a multi-agent reinforcement learning problem, which has much lower complexity and better performance.},

abstract={No single wireless network technology can satisfy all the user requirements. Thus, there is a urgent need to propose a single unified vertical handoff approach that integrates all disparate wireless technologies and enables mobile terminals to seamlessly roam between heterogeneous access networks. The classical approach for Vertical Handoff Decision Algorithm (VHDA) is based on Received Signal Strength (RSS). However, this paper aims to propose a multiple parameter based algorithm, where a Neuro-Fuzzy based supervised learning approach is used for tuning of the training vector. This paper discusses Fuzzy inference system which uses Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) of MATLAB in which triangular membership function and fuzzy based inference engine is used along with neural network for the weight adjustment. The approach shows the gain in throughput and reduced ping pong effect which inturn improves the overall QoS of heterogeneous networks.},

pages={2008-2017}, 
abstract={Next-generation wireless networks will integrate multiple wireless access technologies to provide seamless mobility to mobile users with high-speed wireless connectivity. This will give rise to a heterogeneous wireless access environment where network selection becomes crucial for load balancing to avoid network congestion and performance degradation. We study the dynamics of network selection in a heterogeneous wireless network using the theory of evolutionary games. The competition among groups of users in different service areas to share the limited amount of bandwidth in the available wireless access networks is formulated as a dynamic evolutionary game, and the evolutionary equilibrium is considered to be the solution to this game. We present two algorithms, namely, population evolution and reinforcement-learning algorithms for network selection. Although the network-selection algorithm based on population evolution can reach the evolutionary equilibrium faster, it requires a centralized controller to gather, process, and broadcast information about the users in the corresponding service area. In contrast, with reinforcement learning, a user can gradually learn (by interacting with the service provider) and adapt the decision on network selection to reach evolutionary equilibrium without any interaction with other users. Performance of the dynamic evolutionary game-based network-selection algorithms is empirically investigated. The accuracy of the numerical results obtained from the game model is evaluated by using simulations.},

title={A Novel Approach for Joint Radio Resource Management Based on Fuzzy Neural Methodology},

volume={57},

pages={1789-1805}, 
abstract={In this paper, an innovative mechanism to perform joint radio resource management (JRRM) in the context of heterogeneous radio access networks is introduced. In particular, a fuzzy neural algorithm that is able to ensure certain quality-of-service (QoS) constraints in a multicell scenario deployment with three different radio access technologies (RATs), namely, the wireless local area network (WLAN), the universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS), and the global system for mobile communications (GSM)/Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) radio access network (GERAN), is discussed. The proposed fuzzy neural JRRM algorithm is able to jointly manage the common available radio resources operating in two steps. The first step selects a suitable combination of cells built around the three available RATs, while the second step chooses the most appropriate RAT to which a user should be attached. A proper granted bit rate is also selected for each user in the second step. Different implementations are presented and compared, showing that the envisaged fuzzy neural methodology framework, which is able to cope with the complexities and uncertainties of heterogeneous scenarios, could be a promising choice. Furthermore, simulation results show that the reinforcement learning mechanisms introduced in the proposed JRRM methodology allow guaranteeing the QoS requirement in terms of the so-called user dissatisfaction probability in the presence of different traffic loads and under different dynamic situations. Also, the proposed framework is able to take into consideration different operator policies as well as different subjective criteria by means of a multiple decision-making mechanism, such as balancing the traffic among the RATs or giving more priority to the selection of one RAT in front of another one.},

By superimposing the mobile computing environment onto the multidatabase system, a new computing environment is attained. In this work, we concentrate on the effects of the mobile-computing environment on query processing in multidatabases. Within the broadcasting environment, the organization of the data objects along a single air channel should follow the semantic links assumed within the objects' graph. Learning from our past experiences in objects' organization on conventional storage mediums (disks), we propose a scheme for organizing objects along a single sequential broadcast channel. The proposed schemes are simulated and analyzed},

abstract={The ongoing increasing traffic in the era of big data yields unprecedented demands in user experience and network capacity expansion. The users of next generation mobile networks (5G) should be able to use 3GPP, IEEE, and other technologies simultaneously. The integration of multiple Radio Access Technologies (RATs) of licensed or unlicensed bands has been widely deemed as a cost-efficient way to greatly increase network capacity. In this paper, we propose a Smart Aggregated RAT Access (SARA) strategy with aim of maximizing the long-term network throughput while meeting diverse traffic Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. We consider the scenario that users with different QoS requirements access to a Heterogeneous Network (HetNet) with coexisting Cellular-WiFi. In order to maximize system throughput while meeting diverse traffic QoS requirements in such a complex and dynamic environment, we exploit multi-agent reinforcement learning to perform RAT selection in conjunction with resource allocation for individual user access requests, through sensing dynamic channel states and traffic QoS requirements. In SARA, we first use Nash Q-learning to provide a set of feasible RAT selection strategies while decreasing the strategy space in learning process, and then employ Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based Q-learning to perform resource allocation. Numerical results reveal that the network throughput can be maximized while meeting various traffic QoS requirements with limited number of searches by using our proposed SARA algorithm. For bulk arrival access requests, a suboptimal solution can be obtained as high computational complexity is incurred for achieving global optimality. Another attractive feature of SARA is that a tradeoff between the solution optimality and learning time can be readily made by terminating the search of MCTS according to the time constraint. Compared with traditional WiFi offloading schemes, SARA can significantly improve network throughput whil- guaranteeing traffic QoS requirements.},

abstract={In ultra-dense heterogeneous networks, caching popular contents at small base stations is considered as an effective way to reduce latency and redundant data transmission. Optimization of caching placement/replacement and content delivering can be computationally heavy, especially for large-scale networks. The provision of both time-efficient and high-quality solutions is challenging. Conventional iterative optimization methods, either optimal or heuristic, typically require a large number of iterations to achieve satisfactory performance, and result in considerable computational delay. This may limit their applications in practical network operations where online decisions have to be made. In this paper, we provide a viable alternative to the conventional methods for caching optimization, from a deep learning perspective. The idea is to train the optimization algorithms through a deep neural network (DNN) in advance, instead of directly applying them in real-time caching or scheduling. This allows significant complexity reduction in the delay-sensitive operation phase since the computational burden is shifted to the DDN training phase. Numerical results demonstrate that the DNN is of high computational efficiency. By training the designed DNN over a massive number of instances, the solution quality of the energy-efficient content delivering can be progressively approximated to around 90% of the optimum.},

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for ROI-based video transmission in heterogeneous wireless networks with multi-homed terminals. The framework contains the modules of ROI detector and frame splitter, where macroblocks are categorized based on ROI detection and encapsulated into transforming units. It also includes a channel monitor that keeps track of the status of each communication path and sends feedback signals to the streaming controller for packet-scheduling control; a deep learning method is proposed for channel status prediction. To address the delivery problem, we propose a scheduling approach based on the formulated network model and the rate-distortion model. The scheduling method makes a tradeoff between the transmission delay and the distortion. It also guarantees that packets with ROI content are delivered on paths with sufficient bandwidths and low loss rates. Through comparisons with other scheduling methods, we find that the proposed scheme outperforms the other scheduling methods in terms of improving the quality (peak signal-to-noise ratio), balancing the end-to-end delay, and maintaining the playback fluency.},

abstract={Future wireless networks (e.g., 5G) will consist of multiple radio access technologies (RATs). In these networks, deciding which RAT users should connect to is not a trivial problem. Current fully distributed algorithms although guaranteeing convergence to equilibrium states, are often slow, require high exploration times and may converge to undesirable equilibria. To overcome these limitations, this paper develops a network feedback framework that uses limited network-assisted information to improve efficiency of distributed algorithms for RAT selection problem. We prove theoretically that a fully distributed algorithm developed within this framework is guaranteed to converge to a set of correlated equilibria. Our framework guarantees convergence in self-play even when only a single user applies the algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that our solution: 1) is highly efficient with fast convergence time and low signaling overheads while achieving competitive, if not better, performance both in fairness and utility, as well as achieving lower per-user switchings than state-of-the-art algorithms; and 2) can flexibly support a wide range of network-assisted feedback. The simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution in a heterogeneous environment, where users may potentially apply a number of different RAT selection procedures.},

abstract={In this letter, we consider the problem of RAT selection in a heterogeneous cellular network where each user chooses among multiple access technologies. The competition of the users is modeled as an incomplete information game where players are not aware other players' actions. A RAT selection strategy is proposed and is shown that it converges to the Nash equilibrium of the game. Moreover, we consider a more practical case in which the users have no information about other users. For this case, we propose a Q-learning-based algorithm, which converges to the Nash equilibrium of the first problem.},

abstract={The next generation of wireless networks will provide heterogeneous wireless technologies to a mobile user, in which they can move using terminals with multiple access interfaces and non-real-time or real-time services. The most important issue in such environment is the Always Best Connected (ABC) concept allowing the best connectivity to applications anywhere at any time. With the growing of communication world lot of research is carried out in the field of wireless networks specifically next generation networks. The integration and interoperability of various wireless networks will lead to number of challenges. One of the challenges is the handovers across various/heterogeneous wireless networks as well as reduction of call drop probability. Number of researches has proposed solutions for this challenge. This paper proposes a solution to this problem for the improvement of end-to-end Quality of Service supporting high data rates, real time transmission over wide area and enabling users to specify their personal preferences using Markov Decision Process (MDP). The proposed method uses delay as its basic parameter to select a network during handovers. The selection of the network amongst the existing wireless network considers the ongoing application of the user during the handover. Through simulations we show that our algorithm reduces call drop probability and satisfies user's requirements.},

abstract={This paper investigates the problem of network selection in access control for heterogeneous networks of WCDMA/WLAN. To optimize the network selection decision policy, an optimization equation is defined with the objective of maximizing the total rewards, and then a new Q-learning Based Network Selection (QBNS) mechanism is proposed to solve the equation. In the QBNS Algorithm, Q-learning algorithm is employed by taking both of the network capacity and the quality of service (QoS) requirements of users into account. In addition, the network states are analyzed by considering interference power of WCDMA subnet and channel busyness ratio of WLAN subnet. Simulation results show that the proposed QBNS scheme can obtain lower call blocking probability and much higher total reward performance than the traditional Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) Algorithm.},

abstract={Cognitive radio (CR) is regarded as a solution to address the spectrum scarcity issue in wireless communications. In CR, an unlicensed network user is enabled to dynamically/adaptively access the frequency channels according to the current state of the radio environment and, therefore, CR refers to a smart radio as defined in an “observe-learn-decision” cognitive cycle. In this paper, we consider the medium access control (MAC) protocols as radio parameters in the cognitive cycle, and propose a new approach called MAC protocol identification to implement smart cognitive MAC. The MAC protocol identification approach enables CR users to sense and identify the network MAC protocol types. The identification results will be used by CR users to adaptively change their transmission parameters in order to improve the spectrum hole utilization efficiency, save energy, minimize the interference to the primary users, as well as facilitate communications among heterogeneous CR networks.

abstract={We consider fair delay-optimal user selection and power allocation for a relay-based cooperative wireless network. Each user (mobile station) has an uplink queue with heterogeneous packet arrivals and delay requirements. Our system model consists of a base station, a relay station, and multiple users working in a time-division multiplexing (TDM) fashion, where per-user queuing is employed at the relay station to make the analysis of such system tractable. We model the problem as an infinite-horizon average reward Markov decision problem (MDP) where the control actions are functions of the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) as well as the queue state information (QSI) at the mobile and relay stations. To address the challenge of centralized control and huge complexity of MDP problems, we introduce a distributive and low-complexity solution. A linear structure is employed which approximates the value function of the associated Bellman equation by the sum of per-node value functions. Our online stochastic value iteration solution converges to the optimal solution almost surely (with probability 1) under some realistic conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional delay-aware user selection and power allocation schemes.},

abstract={Network virtualization has been proposed as a powerful and flexible way to support multiple heterogeneous architectures on a shared infrastructure. A major challenge in this respect lies in the resource allocation problem that allocates the resources of Infrastructure Providers (InPs) among Service Providers (SPs) fairly and efficiently. Because of the complexity in the interaction between InPs and SPs, this problem is more complicated and needs more investigation. This paper introduces an InP-SP-End user (ISE) system model in network virtualization environment, in which we present a bandwidth allocation scheme based on VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) to maximize the total revenue of SPs by inhibiting selfish action of SPs, and design a Q-learning strategy algorithm in order to obtain optimal bidding strategies for SPs. Simulations and experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness and the fairness of the proposed scheme, and the convergence of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract={In this paper, admission control by a fuzzy Q-learning technique is proposed for WCDMA/WLAN heterogeneous networks with multimedia traffic. The fuzzy Q-learning admission control (FQAC) system is composed of a neural-fuzzy inference system (NFIS) admissibility estimator, an NFIS dwelling estimator, and a decision maker. The NFIS admissibility estimator takes essential system measures into account to judge how each reachable subnetwork can support the admission request's required QoS and then output admissibility costs. The NFIS dwelling estimator considers the Doppler shift and the power strength of the requested user to assess his/her dwell time duration in each reachable subnetwork and then output dwelling costs. Also, in order to minimize the expected maximal cost of the user's admission request, a minimax theorem is applied in the decision maker to determine the most suitable subnetwork for the user request or to reject. Simulation results show that FQAC can always maintain the system QoS requirement up to traffic intensity of 1.1 because it can appropriately admit or reject the users' admission requests. Also, the FQAC can achieve lower blocking probabilities than conventional JSAC proposed in and can significantly reduce the handoff rate by 15-20 percent.},

abstract={We consider a dynamic multichannel access problem, where multiple correlated channels follow an unknown joint Markov model and users select the channel to transmit data. The objective is to find a policy that maximizes the expected long-term number of successful transmissions. The problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) with unknown system dynamics. To overcome the challenges of unknown dynamics and prohibitive computation, we apply the concept of reinforcement learning and implement a Deep Q-Network (DQN). We first study the optimal policy for fixed-pattern channel switching with known system dynamics and show through simulations that DQN can achieve the same optimal performance without knowing the system statistics. We then compare the performance of DQN with a Myopic policy and a Whittle Index-based heuristic through both more general simulations as well as real data trace and show that DQN achieves near-optimal performance in more complex situations. Finally, we propose an adaptive DQN approach with the capability to adapt its learning in time-varying scenarios.},

abstract={We consider the problem of dynamic spectrum access for network utility maximization in multichannel wireless networks. The shared bandwidth is divided into K orthogonal channels, and the users access the spectrum using a random access protocol. In the beginning of each time slot, each user selects a channel and transmits a packet with a certain attempt probability. After each time slot, each user that has transmitted a packet receives a local observation indicating whether its packet was successfully delivered or not (i.e., ACK signal). The objective is to find a multi-user strategy that maximizes a certain network utility in a distributed manner without online coordination or message exchanges between users. Obtaining an optimal solution for the spectrum access problem is computationally expensive in general due to the large state space and partial observability of the states. To tackle this problem, we develop a distributed dynamic spectrum access algorithm based on deep multi-user reinforcement leaning. Specifically, at each time slot, each user maps its current state to spectrum access actions based on a trained deep-Q network used to maximize the objective function. Experimental results have demonstrated that users are capable to learn good policies that achieve strong performance in this challenging partially observable setting only from their ACK signals, without online coordination, message exchanges between users, or carrier sensing.},

abstract={For achieving optimized spectrum usage, most existing opportunistic spectrum sensing and access protocols model the spectrum sensing and access problem as a partially observed Markov decision process by assuming that the information states and/or the primary users' (PUs) traffic statistics are known a priori to the secondary users (SUs). While theoretically sound, the existing solutions may not be effective in practice due to two main concerns. First, the assumptions are not practical, as before the communication starts, PUs' traffic statistics may not be readily available to the SUs. Second and more serious, existing approaches are extremely vulnerable to malicious jamming attacks. By leveraging the same statistic information and stochastic dynamic decision-making process that the SUs would follow, a cognitive attacker with sensing capability can sense and jam the channels to be accessed by SUs, while not interfering PUs. To address these concerns, we formulate the antijamming, multichannel access problem as a nonstochastic multi-armed bandit problem. By leveraging probabilistically shared information between the sender and the receiver, our proposed protocol enables them to hop to the same set of channels with high probability while gaining resilience to jamming attacks without affecting PUs' activities. We analytically show the convergence of the learning algorithms and derive the performance bound based on regret. We further discuss the problem of tracking the best adaptive strategy and characterize the performance bound based on a new regret. Extensive simulation results show that the probabilistic spectrum sensing and access protocol can overcome the limitation of existing solutions and is highly resilient to various jamming attacks even with jammed acknowledgment (ACK) information.},

abstract={In multichannel cognitive radio networks (CRN), the sequence of sensing order is essential to determine the efficiency of detecting an idle channel and the effective time for spectrum access. Current works on the optimal channel sensing order have to know priori knowledge such as the channel idle probabilities, channel gains and achievable rates of different channels, which dynamically evolve and are difficult to obtain in practice. We are thus motivated to study a model-free sensing order selection scheme for multichannel CRN. In particular, we consider a time-slotted imperfect sensing CRN, where sensing errors impose more challenges to the selection of sensing order. The sensing order selection is modeled as a Q-Learning problem, where secondary users (SU) make intelligent decision on sensing order selection by learning from historical sensing and transmissions. Simulation results show that theq proposed scheme is robust in dynamic environment and can achieve significant throughput improvement compared with random sequential sensing.},

abstract={Since vehicular safety applications require periodic dissemination of status and emergency messages, contention-based medium-access-control (MAC) protocols such as IEEE 802.11p have problems in predictability, fairness, low throughput, latency, and high collision rate, particularly in high-density networks. Therefore, a distributed multichannel and mobility-aware cluster-based MAC (DMMAC) protocol is proposed. Through channel scheduling and an adaptive learning mechanism integrated within the fuzzy-logic inference system (FIS), vehicles organize themselves into more stable and nonoverlapped clusters. Each cluster will use a different subchannel from its neighbors in a distributed manner to eliminate the hidden terminal problem. Increasing the system's reliability, reducing the time delay for vehicular safety applications, and efficiently clustering vehicles in highly dynamic and dense networks in a distributed manner are the main contributions of the proposed MAC protocol. The reliability and connectivity of DMMAC are analyzed in terms of the average cluster size, the communication range within the cluster and between cluster heads (CHs), and the lifetime of a path. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol can support traffic safety and increase vehicular ad hoc networks' (VANETs) efficiency, reliability, and stability of the cluster topology by increasing the CH's lifetime and the dwell time of its members.},

abstract={In this study, we consider optimal opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) policies for a transmitter in a multichannel wireless system, where a channel can be in one of multiple states. In such systems, the transmitter typically does not have complete information on the channel states, but can learn by probing individual channels at the expense of certain resources, e.g., energy and time. The main goal is to derive optimal strategies for determining which channels to probe, in what sequence, and which channel to use for transmission. We consider two problems within this context and show that they are equivalent to different data maximization and throughput maximization problems. For both problems, we derive key structural properties of the corresponding optimal strategy. In particular, we show that it has a threshold structure and can be described by an index policy. We further show that the optimal strategy for the first problem can only take one of three structural forms. Using these results, we first present a dynamic program that computes the optimal strategy within a finite number of steps, even when the state space is uncountably infinite. We then present and examine a more efficient, but suboptimal, two-step look-ahead strategy for each problem. These strategies are shown to be optimal for a number of cases of practical interest. We examine their performance via numerical studies.},

abstract={This paper designs a robust discriminative tracking method based on correlation filter and key point matching, the highlight of which is the ability to adapt appearance changes. Toward the complicated and changeable real-world scene, a multi-channel of optimal selection correlation filter (MOSCF) is proposed, and it can model the holistic appearances by learning short-term dynamic features. Meantime, a key point feature set is maintained for representing the long-term stable appearances. In order to combine the similarity evaluation scores of two appearance features, a confidence fusion framework is established to obtain the final output confidence map. Particularly, partially occluded object is located by a kind of local key point voting mechanism. To alleviate error accumulation caused by inappropriate learning, an adaptive learning ratio is set to independently update the filter template corresponding to each channel of MOSCF. The results of the qualitative and quantitative experiments on the OTB-100 benchmark suggest that the proposed tracker outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) networks allow opportunistic spectrum access to license exempt secondary nodes. Usually secondary nodes employ a cooperative sensing mechanism to correctly infer spectrum occupancy. However, the possibility of falsification of locally sensed occupancy report, also known as secondary spectrum data falsification (SSDF) can cripple the operation of secondary networks. In this paper, we propose a multivariate Bayesian trust model for secondary nodes in a distributed DSA network. The proposed model accurately incorporates anomalous behavior as well as monitoring uncertainty that might arise from an anomaly detection scheme. We also propose possible extensions to the SSDF attack techniques. Subsequently, we use a machine learning approach to learn the thresholds for classifying nodes as honest or malicious based on their trust values. The threshold based classification is shown to perform well under different path loss environments and with varying degrees of attacks by the malicious nodes. We also show the trust based fusion model can be used by nodes to disregard a node's information while fusing the individual reports. Using the fusion scheme, we report the improvements of cooperative spectrum decisions for various multi-channel SSDF techniques.},

To address the disadvantages faced in the UD auction, we propose a learning-based unit demand (LBUD) auction. It incorporates a distributed learning of the primary channel availabilities into the auction mechanism to explore both primary channel availability statistics and instantaneous link gains of the SUs for their throughput maximization. The new mechanism not only substantially reduces communication overhead, but also improves the SUs' throughputs when the primary channels have dissimilar availability statistics. We show that the proposed LBUD auction for channel allocation among SUs preserves the strong property of the UD auction.

abstract={We consider the problem of online dynamic channel accessing in multi-hop cognitive radio networks. Previous works on online dynamic channel accessing mainly focus on single-hop networks that assume complete conflicts among all secondary users. In the multi-hop multi-channel network settings studied here, there is more general competition among different communication pairs. A simple application of models for single-hop case to multi-hop case with N nodes and M channels leads to exponential time/space complexity O (MN), and poor theoretical guarantee on throughput performance. We thus novelly formulate the problem as a linearly combinatorial multi-armed bandits (MAB) problem that involves a maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem with unknown weights. To efficiently address the problem, we propose a distributed channel access algorithm that can achieve 1/ρ of the optimum averaged throughput where each node has communication complexity O (r2+D) and space complexity O (m) in the learning process, and time complexity O (D mρr) in strategy decision process for an arbitrary wireless network. Here ρ = 1 + ε is the approximation ratio to MWIS for a local r-hop network with m <; N nodes, and D is the number of mini-rounds inside each round of strategy decision.},

abstract={In a distributed cognitive radio network, due to negative network externality, rational secondary users tend to avoid accessing the same vacant primary channels with others. Moreover, they usually need to make their channel access decisions in a sequential manner to avoid collisions. The characteristic of negative network externality and the structure of sequential decision making make the multi-channel sensing and access problem challenging, which has not been well studied by the existing literatures. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a multi-channel sensing and access game, which not only considers the negative network externality in secondary users' decision making, but also takes into account their sequential decision making structure. We solve the multi-channel sensing problem using Bayesian learning method and design a cooperative learning rule for secondary users to accurately estimate the channel state. We study the multi-channel access problem under two scenarios: with and without resource constraint, respectively. For both scenarios, we design recursive best response algorithms for secondary users to find the subgame perfect Nash equilibria. Specifically, we analyze the homogenous case of the scenario without resource constraint and find that the Nash equilibrium profile exhibits a threshold structure. Finally, we conduct simulations to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.},

abstract={Multi-channel opportunistic spectrum access in unslotted primary systems is considered. The primary occupancy of each channel is modeled as a general on-off renewal process. The distributions of the busy and idle times and the utilization factors of all channels are unknown to the secondary user. The objective of the secondary user is to identify and exploit the best channel (i.e., the channel with the least primary traffic) through efficient online learning. A dynamic channel access policy is constructed that achieves the throughput offered by the best channel under certain mild conditions on the busy/idle time distributions. More specifically, the cost associated with learning the unknown channel occupancy models over a horizon of length T diminishes at the rate of log T/T. The policy is obtained by constructing a hypothetical multi-armed bandit with virtual reward which, while not directly reflecting throughput, preserves the ranking of the channels in terms of throughput.},

abstract={Consider a wireless system where a transmitter may send data to a set of receivers, or on various channels, experiencing random time-varying fading. The transmitter can send data to a single receiver or on a single channel at a time and may adapt its transmission power to the radio conditions of the chosen receiver/channel. Its objective is to implement a strategy defining at each time how to select the receiver/channel and transmission power, so as to maximize its throughput, i.e., its average sending rate, under an average power constraint. The optimization problem is easy when the fading conditions of all the receivers/channels are known. In many situations however, the instantaneous fading conditions are not known a priori, instead they have to be acquired, i.e., receivers/channels have to be probed, which consumes resources (time, spectrum, energy) in proportion of the number of probed receivers/channels. Hence, the transmitter may choose not to acquire the radio conditions of all the receivers/channels so as to spare resources for actual transmissions. In this paper, we aim at characterizing a joint probing, receiver/channel selection and power control strategy maximizing throughput. We provide an adaptive algorithm converging to the throughput optimal strategy. This algorithm may be used in a wide class of wireless systems with limited information, such as broadcast systems without a priori knowledge of the instantaneous Channel-State Information (CSI). But it can be also used to solve dynamic spectrum access problems such as those arising in cognitive radio systems, where secondary users can access large parts of the spectrum, but have to discover which portions of the spectrum offer more favorable radio conditions or less interference from primary users.},

abstract={As wireless systems are prevalently deployed, wireless coexistence problems are arising as an inevitable issue. In particular, since the IEEE802.15.4 LR-WPAN, which has limited resources, is more vulnerable to effects of several interferences, it is necessary for development of an efficient interference-avoidance scheme. In this paper, we propose an efficient interference-avoidance scheme for LR-WPAN, in which a coordinator learns interference environment surrounding the WPAN, utilizing multi-channel/multi-frame, and thereby the assured communications are enabled through a clean channel. In addition, none of modifications in PHY is required for the proposed scheme utilizing logical multi-channels. Specifically, the proposed scheme can conserve energy by utilizing minimal effective channels for minimizing the overhead in multi-channel management without degradation of interference-avoidance performance.},

abstract={With the advent of the fifth generation of wireless standards and an increasing demand for higher throughput, methods to improve spectral efficiency of wireless systems have become very important. In the context of cognitive radio, a substantial increase in throughput is possible if the secondary user can make smart decisions regarding which channel to sense and when or how often to sense. Here, we propose an algorithm to not only select a channel for data transmission, but also to predict how long the channel will remain unoccupied so that the time spent on channel sensing can be minimized. Our algorithm learns in two stages - a reinforcement learning approach for channel selection and a Bayesian approach to determine the duration for which sensing can be skipped. Comparisons with other methods are provided through extensive simulations. We show that the number of sensing operations is minimized with negligible increase in primary user interference; this implies that less energy is spent by the secondary user in sensing, and also higher throughput is achieved by saving the time spent on sensing.},

abstract={We consider the problem of dynamic spectrum access for network utility maximization in multichannel wireless networks. The shared bandwidth is divided into K orthogonal channels, and the users access the spectrum using a random access protocol. In the beginning of each time slot, each user selects a channel and transmits a packet with a certain attempt probability. After each time slot, each user that has transmitted a packet receives a local observation indicating whether its packet was successfully delivered or not (i.e., ACK signal). The objective is to find a multi-user strategy that maximizes a certain network utility in a distributed manner without online coordination or message exchanges between users. Obtaining an optimal solution for the spectrum access problem is computationally expensive in general due to the large state space and partial observability of the states. To tackle this problem, we develop a distributed dynamic spectrum access algorithm based on deep multi-user reinforcement leaning. Specifically, at each time slot, each user maps its current state to spectrum access actions based on a trained deep-Q network used to maximize the objective function. Experimental results have demonstrated that users are capable to learn good policies that achieve strong performance in this challenging partially observable setting only from their ACK signals, without online coordination, message exchanges between users, or carrier sensing.},

abstract={In this paper, the problem of distributed throughput maximization in an Opportunistic Spectrum Access (OSA) net- work with multiple secondary users (SUs) and multiple primary channels is investigated. To address the challenges in designing efficient solutions in dynamic and unknown environment, we formulate the optimization problem as a noncooperative game, which is further proved to be an ordinal potential game. We then propose a Best Response (BR) based algorithm to achieve the Nash Equilibrium Points (NEPs) of the formulated game, given that there exists a coordinator for SUs to work in a round- robin fashion and a common control channel for SUs to exchange their information. To further relieve the system overhead due to information exchange among SUs, we design a new Stochastic Learning Automata (SLA) based algorithm, called N-SLA, which can converge to the pure-strategy NEPs of the formulated ordinal potential game in a fully distributed way. To our best knowledge, we are the first to address the convergence issue of the SLA based algorithms for general ordinal potential games. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.},

abstract={The key enabling technology in dynamic spectrum access is Cognitive Radio that allows unlicensed secondary users to access the licensed bands without causing any interference to the primary users. In any situation where there are a certain number of secondary networks trying to get an available channel, there arises a game theoretic competition where they want to get the channel for themselves by incurring as minimum cost as possible. The increase in cost is equivalent to the increase in time caused by the need of a search for an available channel. This process could be sped up if the networks had a predictive mechanism to determine the optimal strategy. In this paper, we investigate various predictive algorithms: Linear regression, Support Vector Regression and Elastic Net and compare them with other traditional non-predictive game theoretic mechanisms. We measure the accuracy of these algorithms in terms of time taken to reach the system convergence. We also observe how a self-learning approach can be helpful in maximizing utilities of the players in comparison to traditional game theoretic approaches.},

abstract={This paper investigates the problem of dynamic spectrum access for canonical wireless networks, in which the channel states are time-varying. In the most existing work, the commonly used optimization objective is to maximize the expectation of a certain metric (e.g., throughput or achievable rate). However, it is realized that expectation alone is not enough since some applications are sensitive to fluctuations. Effective capacity is a promising metric for time-varying service process since it characterizes the packet delay violating probability (regarded as an important statistical quality-of-service index), by taking into account not only the expectation but also other high-order statistic. Therefore, we formulate the interactions among the users in the time-varying environment as a non-cooperative game, in which the utility function is defined as the achieved effective capacity. We prove that it is an ordinal potential game which has at least one pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Based on an approximated utility function, we propose a multi-agent learning algorithm which is proved to achieve stable solutions with dynamic and incomplete information constraints. The convergence of the proposed learning algorithm is verified by simulation results. Also, it is shown that the proposed multi-agent learning algorithm achieves satisfactory performance.},

abstract={This paper presents a robust dynamic spectrum access (DSA) decision making framework for a satellite communication (SATCOM) system with primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs) operating in the presence of cognitive jammers. Different levels of uncertainty are considered for the channel availability under SATCOM delays and jamming effects. Spectrum uncertainty is quantified regarding the parameter estimation for Markov model of spectrum occupancy and the prediction of future channel states under SATCOM delays. Based on these uncertainty models, the optimal spectrum sensing approach is used to identify available channels. Both offline and online algorithms are used for DSA. Offline algorithm first learns spectrum dynamics and then applies DSA, whereas online learning repeats this process and adapts to fast spectrum dynamics. Results show performance gains of DSA over the case without considering spectrum uncertainty.},

In dynamic spectrum access, based on a reliable prediction scheme, a secondary user chooses a channel with the longest idle time for data transmission. In this paper, four supervised machine learning techniques, two from ANN, i.e. Multilayer Perceptron & Recurrent Neural Networks, and two from Support Vector Machines (SVM), i.e. SVM with Linear Kernel, SVM with Gaussian Kernel, have been employed to investigate the prediction of primary activity. Poisson, Interrupted Poisson and Self-similar traffics are used for the analysis of licensed user environment.

We also propose simple two-phase heuristics for allocating spectrum and power resources among users. The proposed heuristics split the spectrum and power allocation problem into two subproblems, and solve each of them separately. The spectrum allocation problem is solved, during the first phase using learning. Two procedures to learn the channel selection are proposed and compared in terms of optimality, scalability, and robustness. The power allocation, on the other hand, is formulated as a real optimization problem and solved, during the second phase, by traditional optimization solvers. Simulation results show that energy and cross-layer awareness and multiple channel access capability improve the performance of the system in terms of the per-user average rewards received from accessing the dynamic spectrum access system. In addition, the two proposed methods for channel selection via learning represent a tradeoff between optimality, scalability, and robustness.},

abstract={We design distributed online learning and channel access for secondary users in a cognitive radio network. Our goal is to design channel selection and access that can effectively adapt to a wide range of traffic load patterns in the primary network. We propose a distributed adaptive learning and access policy by applying stochastic learning automata (SLA), where each secondary user (SU) probabilistically chooses one of the most available channels to access, with the channel selection probabilities being updated based on the collision events. Our design includes two underlying distributed learning algorithms: learning of primary channel availabilities from each SU's own sensing history, and SLA-based learning of channel selection from each SU's own collision history for collision avoidance. We show that some existing distributed access policies can be viewed as special cases of our proposed adaptive policy, with a set of fixed channel selection probabilities. Next, we formulate the distributed channel selection and access problem as a noncooperative game. We show that it is an exact potential game with at least one pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE). We prove that, under our proposed adaptive policy, the channel selection probabilities converge toward a pure strategy NE of the game. Simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed adaptive policy in a wide range of distributions of mean channel availabilities, as compared with other existing policies.},

abstract={Cognitive radio (CR) is considered as a key enabling technology for dynamic spectrum access to improve spectrum efficiency. Although the CR concept was invented with the core idea of realizing "cognition", the research on measuring CR cognition capabilities and intelligence is largely open. Deriving the intelligence capabilities of CR not only can lead to the development of new CR technologies, but also makes it possible to better configure the networks by integrating CRs with different intelligence capabilities in a more cost- efficient way. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a data-driven methodology to quantitatively analyze the intelligence factors of the CR with learning capabilities. The basic idea of our methodology is to run various tests on the CR in different spectrum environments under different settings and obtain various performance results on different metrics. Then we apply factor analysis on the performance results to identify and quantize the intelligence capabilities of the CR. More specifically, we present a case study consisting of sixty three different types of CRs. CRs are different in terms of learning-based dynamic spectrum access strategies, number of sensors, sensing accuracy, and processing speed. Based on our methodology, we analyze the intelligence capabilities of the CRs through extensive simulations. Four intelligence capabilities are identified for the CRs through our analysis, which comply with the nature of the tested algorithms.},

This is crucial for achieving the flexibility required in the so-called Industrie 4.0. In this work we present a single channel cognitive medium access control (MAC) protocol for wireless industrial communication in highly dynamic shared environments. The protocol design utilizes traffic models based on measurements of industrial wireless traffic in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. The proposed protocol enables optimum spectrum use and throughput by equipping nodes with predictive channel access. We address the problem of predictive channel access where cognitive networks are 1) either aware only of non-cognitive networks or 2) aware of other cognitive networks as well due to continuous online learning. The proposed protocol supports service differentiation, i.e. critical industrial applications could be assigned higher priorities when accessing the channel in order to fulfill their strict delay requirements. We also develop a highly accurate theoretical framework for predictive channel access and validate the proposed framework through extensive simulations. Simulation results show optimal throughput and spectrum use and a significant improvement on WiFi's Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA).},

Therefore, it is desirable that a RAT identification system, which can easily cope with the diversification of RATs, is applied to cognitive radio. The purpose of this study is to identify multiple RATs in the same frequency band by using online learning. In order to improve the identification accuracy of RATs with similar features, we proposed a normalization method for radio features extracted from the signal's spectrogram. We evaluated the RAT classifier created using the proposed method by calculating the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and the identification accuracy. The results of the ROC curve revealed that the proposed method is effective for some supervised learning. Moreover, the results of the identification accuracy revealed that it could improve the identification accuracy for multiple RATs on the same frequency by nearly 40%.},

abstract={License Assisted Access (LAA) is the technology introduced by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) that enables the deployment of LTE networks in the unlicensed 5 GHz spectrum. To ensure a fair coexistence of LAA in the unlicensed spectrum with other technologies, e.g., with Wi-Fi, 3GPP has standardized the use of Listen Before Talk (LBT) as the default channel-access scheme for LAA. However, the performance of Wi-Fi when coexisting with LAA mainly relies on how the LBT parameters are configured by the LAA. In this paper, we focus on the Contention Window (CW) size parameter of LBT in LAA. We propose a Neural Network (NN) based scheme that adapts the CW size based on the predicted number of Negative Acknowledgments (NACKs) for all the subframes in a Transmit Opportunity (TXOP) of LAA. In particular, our proposed scheme learns from the past experience how many NACKs per subframe of a TXOP were received under certain channel conditions. The performance evaluation shows that our proposed scheme, when compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, provides the best trade-off between the fairness to Wi-Fi and the LAA performance in terms of both throughput and latency.},

abstract={A cognitive radio network introduces the idea of spectrum sharing among primary users and secondary users in the radio network. A dynamic spectrum access is the core technology of a cognitive radio network; in which unoccupied spectrum resources that are sensed by the cognitive radios can be efficiently utilized without disturbing the primary members. Unlike commercial network, each secondary radio node in military network can be allocated with unfair spectrum resources depending on its priority. This article exploits the cooperative dynamic spectrum allocation that every secondary members in the network can cooperatively allocate the available spectrum resources based on their needs and priorities. The evolutionary algorithm, specifically the particle swarm optimization, is explored and applied to the spectrum allocation such that a secondary member can learn and adapt to the spectrum access to optimize overall reward under the constraints of spectrum resource limitation, system limitation, and quality of services (QoS) of tactical data. The result from the experiment shows that the priority-based evolutionary algorithm yields better reward than the fair-based evolutionary algorithm and the random allocation algorithm.},

abstract={In this paper, the problem of joint caching and resource allocation is investigated for a network of cache-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that service wireless ground users over the LTE licensed and unlicensed (LTE-U) bands. The considered model focuses on users that can access both licensed and unlicensed bands while receiving contents through UAV cache-user links and content server-UAV-user links. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem which jointly incorporates user association, spectrum allocation, and content caching. To solve this problem, a distributed algorithm based on the machine learning framework of liquid state machine (LSM) is proposed. Using the proposed LSM algorithm, the cloud can predict the users' content request distribution while having only limited information on the network's and users' states. The proposed algorithm also enables the UAVs to autonomously choose the optimal resource allocation strategies depending on the network states. Simulation results using real datasets show that the proposed approach yields up to 33.3% and 50.3% gains, respectively, in terms of the number of users that have stable queues compared to two baseline algorithms: Q-learning with cache and Q-learning without cache. The results also show that LSM significantly improves the convergence time of up to 33.3% compared to Q-learning.},

year={2017}, 
volume={},

pages={1-6}, 
abstract={Despite the great promises in next-generation wireless communications, dynamic spectrum access (DSA) remains still as a major challenge in uncertain environments, e.g., varying unknown channels. Existing popular schemes, i.e. potential game approaches, rely on the definite reward and a greedy strategy, which become unfortunately invalid in such varying and uncertain scenarios. In this paper, we propose a robust fuzzy-game approach to combat inherent channel uncertainties. Rather than the definite reward, we first project the decision space to another fuzzy-logical space and thereby characterize the varying uncertain information with the fuzzy numbers. Thus, the sensitiveness to random fluctuation in definite rewards would be alleviated. On this basis, we formulate DSA in uncertain channels as a centralized fuzzy payoffs game (FPG). We then develop a novel fuzzy-learning algorithm to achieve the optimal network throughput even in face of uncertain information, with which the network controller executes the decision making of sharing users by exploiting the fuzzy-logic method. Numerical results are finally provided to validate our new FPG scheme. Although uncertain environments render existing crisp-game approaches invalid, our new algorithm can converge after tens of iterations (even in fast-varying conditions), thereby permitting reliable shared accessing and improved throughput, which is of great significance to next- generation communications operated in dynamical and uncertain environments.},

abstract={Sharing spectrum with a communicating incumbent user (IU) network requires avoiding interference to IU receivers. But since receivers are passive when in the receive mode and cannot be detected, the network topology can be used to predict the potential receivers of a currently active transmitter. For this purpose, this paper proposes a method to detect the directed links between IUs of time multiplexing communication networks from their transmission start and end times. It models the response mechanism of commonly used communication protocols using Granger causality: The probability of an IU starting a transmission after another IU's transmission ends increases if the former is a receiver of the latter. This paper proposes a nonparametric test statistic for detecting such behavior. To help differentiate between a response and the opportunistic access of the available spectrum, the same test statistic is used to estimate the response time of each link. The causal structure of the response is studied through a discrete time Markov chain that abstracts the IUs' medium access protocol and focuses on the response time and response probability of 2 IUs. Through NS-3 simulations, it is shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods in accurately learning the topologies of infrastructure-based networks and that it can infer the directed data flow in ad hoc networks with finer time resolution than an existing method.},

abstract={Using public cloud for image storage has become a prevalent trend with the rapidly increasing number of pictures generated by various devices. For example, today's most smartphones and tablets synchronize photo albums with cloud storage platforms. However, as many images contain sensitive information, such as personal identities and financial data, it is concerning to upload images to cloud storage. To eliminate such privacy concerns in cloud storage while keeping decent data management and search features, a spectrum of keywords-based searchable encryption (SE) schemes have been proposed in the past decade. Unfortunately, there is a fundamental gap remains open for their support of images, i.e., appropriate keywords need to be extracted for images before applying SE schemes to them. On one hand, it is obviously impractical for smartphone users to manually annotate their images. On the other hand, although cloud storage services now offer image annotation services, they rely on access to users' unencrypted images. To fulfill this gap and open the first path from SE schemes to images, this paper proposes a cloud assisted privacy-preserving automatic image annotation scheme, namely CAPIA. CAPIA enables cloud storage users to automatically assign keywords to their images by leveraging the power of cloud computing. Meanwhile, CAPIA prevents the cloud from learning the content of images and their keywords. Thorough analysis is carried out to demonstrate the security of CAPIA. A prototype implementation over the well-known IAPR TC-12 dataset further validates the efficiency and accuracy of CAPIA.},

abstract={This article presents a comprehensive survey of the literature on self-interference management schemes required to achieve a single frequency full duplex communication in wireless communication networks. A single frequency full duplex system often referred to as in-band full duplex (FD) system has emerged as an interesting solution for the next generation mobile networks where scarcity of available radio spectrum is an important issue. Although studies on the mitigation of self-interference have been documented in the literature, this is the first holistic attempt at presenting not just the various techniques available for handling self-interference that arises when a full duplex device is enabled, as a survey, but it also discusses other system impairments that significantly affect the self-interference management of the system, and not only in terrestrial systems, but also on satellite communication systems. The survey provides a taxonomy of self-interference management schemes and shows by means of comparisons the strengths and limitations of various self-interference management schemes. It also quantifies the amount of self-interference cancellation required for different access schemes from the 1 st generation to the candidate 5 th generation of mobile cellular systems. Importantly, the survey summarises the lessons learnt, identifies and presents open research questions and key research areas for the future. This paper is intended to be a guide and take off point for further work on self-interference management in order to achieve full duplex transmission in mobile networks including heterogeneous cellular networks which is undeniably the network of future wireless systems.},

abstract={In cognitive radio systems, fast and efficient spectrum selection is a vital task to minimize the overhead of spectrum scanning, and hence to improve the response time of the system. So, the choice of channel sensing sequence plays an important role for better performance of the system. This paper proposes a co-operative Q-learning based spectrum sensing technique for the secondary users of an ad hoc network to access the primary channels. By the proposed technique, every secondary user (SU) maintains a dynamic priority list of channels based on Q-learning from its own action-observation history, as well as from spatial channel information exchange among its local neighbors. Whenever there is a demand an SU scans the spectrum according to the order in the priority list until there is a success. Simulation studies show that with significantly less computing and scanning overhead, our proposed Q-learning based approach improves the response time and call block/drop rate to offer better performance compared to other contemporary reinforcement learning based approaches.},

abstract={Cross Technology Interference (CTI) is a prevalent phenomenon in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed spectrum causing packet losses and increased channel contention. In particular, WiFi interference is a severe problem for low-power wireless networks causing a significant degradation of the overall performance. We propose here a proactive approach based on WiFi interference modeling for accurately predicting transmission opportunities for low-power wireless networks. We leverage statistical analysis of real-world WiFi traces to learn aggregated traffic characteristics in terms of Inter-Arrival Time (IAT) that, once captured into a specific 2nd order Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP(2)) model, enable accurate estimation of interference. We further use a hidden Markov model (HMM) for channeloccupancy prediction. We evaluated the performance of: i) the MMPP(2) traffic model w. r. t. real-world traces and an existing Pareto model for accurately characterizing the WiFi traffic and, ii) compared the HMM based white space prediction to random channel access. We report encouraging results for using interference modeling for white space prediction.},

abstract={In this paper, the throughput maximization of millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) ultra-dense networks (UDN) using dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) is considered. Most of the existing works only allow temporal-domain access and admit at most one user at each time slot, resulting in significant under-utilization of spectrum resource, which will be less attractive to mm-wave UDN applications. A generalized temporal-spatial sharing scheme is proposed in this paper for UDN by exploiting the location information of incumbent devices, where multiple users are allowed to access each channel simultaneously via spatial separations. For distributed applications, the global information exchange among secondary users (SU) tends to be impractical, given the unaffordable signaling overhead and latency. Thus, a non-cooperative game with fine-grained two-dimensional reuse is formulated, which leads to a more efficient access strategy. It is then proved to be an ordinary potential game (OPG), which guarantees the existence of the strategy Nash equilibrium (NE). Finally, an improved decentralized reinforcement learning algorithm is designed, with which SUs can learn from wireless environments and adapt towards to a NE point, relying on the individual observation and the historical action-reward (rather than the global information exchanging). The convergence efficiency of the new scheme is also rigorously proved. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the performances of the proposed schemes.},

abstract={Exponentially growing demand on mobile data facilitates the need to increase spectrum efficiency and also to gain access to additional spectrum bands. LTE-U provides a way for LTE service to be provided, in some regulatory areas, using a combination of licensed and unlicensed spectrum. In this paper, we consider the resource allocation problem in LTE-U networks with downlink-uplink decoupling (DUDe) technique. Here, the spectrum allocation problem is formulated as a game theoretic model which incorporates user association, spectrum allocation, and load balancing. We propose a decentralized expected Q-learning algorithm to solve this game. Using the proposed algorithm, the base stations can autonomously choose their optimal spectrum allocation schemes based on only limited information from the networks. It is shown that the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary mixed-strategy distribution which constitutes a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for the studied game. Simulation results show the proposed Q-learning algorithm yields up to 12.7% and 51.1% improvement in terms of total rate, compared to traditional Q-learning and nearest neighbor algorithms, respectively. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed Q-learning algorithm always converges to a mixed Nash equilibrium, and need 19% less time to coverage compared to traditional Q-learning.},

Without any priori knowledge about the channels and jammers, it is very challenging to design an efficient and practical jamming-resistant SAA algorithm to reach the optimal EE goal. In this paper, we utilize the advanced martingale concentration inequalities in an multi-armed bandits-based online learning framework to facilitate the optimal detection of various jamming behaviors. We first define a novel EE model for discontiguous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing to facilitate scalable SAA over distributed spectrum pools in practice. Then, the jamming-resistant dynamic channel access problem is formulated as a regret minimization problem. Meanwhile, an online stochastic gradient descent with bandit feedback procedure is adopted to allocate the transmit power. The proposed algorithm can autonomously detect the environmental features and find a near-optimal solution in each attacking scenario. Our algorithm is implemented with low complexity and with multiple users under some practical jamming scenarios. Extensive numerical studies show that under some practical jamming scenarios, our algorithm has an EE improvement of 45.3% over a fixed learning period, and an improvement of 82.5% in terms of learning duration compared with existing approaches.},

abstract={Learning-based sensing policies for multi-band flexible spectrum use, in particular cognitive radios operating in non-stationary radio environments are proposed. The proposed policies stem from the stochastic non-stationary restless multi-armed bandit formulation of opportunistic spectrum access. The non-stationary radio environment assumed in this paper is an appropriate model for a realistic cognitive radio systems, where the obtainable data rates depend on many unknown time-varying factors. These are e.g. mobility, fading and primary user activity. The developed policies are index policies, where the index of a frequency band depends on the discounted average reward of the band and a recency-based exploration bonus. The exploration bonus encourages sensing frequency bands that have not been explored for a long time. However, there is a maximum number of time instances when any band can remain unexplored. These index policies are computationally simple making them attractive for mobile cognitive radios. In our simulation examples, we demonstrate that the proposed policies can often provide higher cumulative data rate than other existing state-of-the-art policies.},

abstract={We explore machine learning pattern recognition techniques as a means of informing intelligent secondary user dynamic spectrum access (DSA) strategies in a cognitive radio environment. We present a framework for learning and inferring primary user protocol state at the application and MAC layers from simple energy detector features. The resulting knowledge about the primary user protocol can be exploited by a secondary user to identify access opportunities, and to recognize when secondary user traffic has disrupted the normal behavior of the primary user. We apply Bayesian nonparametric structure learning techniques to construct Hidden Markov Models (HMM) representing primary user wireless network traffic. The learned HMM models have a highly interpretable hidden state structure that provides insight into the actual state machine of the underlying communication protocol. This framework provides efficient procedures for online protocol classification and state inference that enable the secondary user to reason intelligently about the primary user environment, and develop more efficient and adaptive DSA policies. Experimental results obtained on a wireless network testbed show that our approach learns hidden states that correspond to actual primary user application layer protocol states and also detects anomalous primary user behavior caused by secondary user interference.},

abstract={In this paper, we quantify the trustworthiness of secondary nodes that share spectrum sensing reports in a distributed dynamic spectrum access network. We propose a spatio-spectral anomaly monitoring technique that effectively captures anomalies in the spectrum sensing reports shared by individual cognitive radio nodes. Based on this, we propose an optimistic trust model for a system with a normal risk attitude and using approximation to the Beta distribution. For a more conservative and risk averse system, we propose a multinomial Dirichlet distribution-based conservative trust framework. Using a machine learning approach, we classify malicious nodes with a high degree of certainty regardless of their aggressiveness of attacks or variations introduced by the wireless environment. Subsequently, we propose two instantaneous fusion models: 1) optimistic trust-based fusion and 2) conservative trust-based fusion, which exclude untrustworthy sensing reports from participating nodes during spectrum data fusion. Our work considers random, deterministic, and preferential (ON-OFF) attack models to demonstrate the utility of our proposed model under varied attack scenarios. Through extensive simulation experiments, we show that the trust values help identify malicious nodes with a high degree of certainty.},

abstract={In this work, we study the wideband sensing problem of detecting intermittently transmitting signals that may have partial spectral overlap. We aim to estimate the frequency bands occupied by transmitters using standards with overlapping frequency bands, such as IEEE 802.11, and those without guard bands, such as LTE-Advanced. Multiple power spectrum measurements are used to distinguish the distinct bands. An extreme ray based non-negative matrix factorization algorithm is proposed to identify measurements where a single transmitter is active. Distinct bands are identified in the presence of frequency selective fading by using a combinatorial search. In addition, we propose a novel algorithm to automatically estimate the noise power spectrum by identifying measurements that do not have significant signal energy. Its ability to learn colored noise and LO leakage in the signal is demonstrated through USRP measurements. The dependence of the proposed algorithm's performance on the medium access control protocol used by the primary users is discussed. MATLAB simulations are used to verify that the proposed algorithm detects the occupied bands more accurately than existing methods. Over the air USRP measurements in the 2.4 GHz ISM band are used to detect the occupied WiFi channels in a university environment.},

abstract={Individuals diagnosed with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) often exhibit multiple challenging behaviors such as stereotyping, non-compliance, self-injuries, and aggression. The lack of a target behavior across schools, homes, and clinical settings not only impedes an individual learning on academic and self-help skills, but also disrupts their integration into school and society. To maintain the target behavior, the study successfully evaluated various reinforcement strategies. On the basis of a preliminary study conducted with a small group of children diagnosed with developmental disorders at an Autism intervention clinic in India concluded that video games can be used to strongly reinforce the expected behavior and reduce problematic behavior, successfully. Consequently, a survey carried out with various experts within India and abroad confirm that videogames designed on a tablet format are successfully used as strong reinforces during behavioral interventions. In view of these aspects, the present study proposes a multi-stage videogame design that is built with a user interface and smart algorithm allowing access and progression in the game based on a childs behavior data. The design establishes a contingency between reinforcer (videogame) and childs behavior thereby improving the acceptable target behavior.},

abstract={For high spectrum usage, some independent wireless communication systems should share multi-channel environment. An offloading effect over multi-channel makes system throughput enhanced. A multi-channel access based on channel activities of other systems, which are channel occupancy ratio (COR), is important. The estimation of COR needs a traceability to the transition of COR. In software define radio, the time loss for reconfiguring RF and baseband processing occurs. Therefore, the construction of multi-channel access protocol requires an implemented evaluation in wireless equipment. This paper implements the learning assisted measurement of COR, which the author originally proposed, to a universal software radio peripheral (USRP). We clarify the tradeoff between the accessing rate to an assumed suitable channel and the traceability to the transition of COR. As a result, the optimal multi-channel access for maximizing the finding probability of vacant channel is derived.},

abstract={Accurate gathering of phenotypic information is a key aspect in several subject matters, including biometrics, biomedical analysis, forensics, and many other. Automatic identification of anatomical structures of biometric interest, such as fingerprints, iris patterns, or facial traits, are extensively used in applications like access control and anthropological research, all having in common the drawback of requiring intrusive means for acquiring the required information. In this regard, the ear structure has multiple advantages. Not only the ear's biometric markers can be easily captured from the distance with non intrusive methods, but also they experiment almost no changes over time, and are not influenced by facial expressions. Here we present a new method based on Geometric Morphometrics and Deep Learning for automatic ear detection and feature extraction in the form of landmarks. A convolutional neural network was trained with a set of manually landmarked examples. The network is able to provide morphometric landmarks on ears' images automatically, with a performance that matches human landmarking. The feasibility of using ear landmarks as feature vectors opens a novel spectrum of biometrics applications.},

These systems leverage cognitive radio concepts to automatically identify suitable spectrum for users, avoiding harmful interference with higher priority users. An infrastructure of spectrum sensors is a key component of the spectrum access system, providing the means for the system to identify necessary protections. The geolocation precision of the sensing system will be limited in practice due to privacy concerns of the priority users as well as cost limitations. In this work, we examine the design options for the sensing component of a spectrum access system in terms of user performance and privacy. We apply machine learning techniques to treat the problem of estimating the priority users' state from sensor measurements, finding that the geolocation precision is closely tied to the density of the sensor deployment, and that the secondary user performance degrades rapidly if the density is too low, highlighting a tradeoff between priority user privacy and secondary user performance.},

To model the competition amongst SUs, we formulate the spectrum access problem as a {it distributed welfare game}, in which at each iteration each SU has to compute its marginal contribution to the system's welfare. Moreover, the SUs also need to decide which resource (channel) they should access at the next iteration. To address these challenges, we propose a stochastic learning algorithm based on payoff-based log-linear learning and prove its convergence towards a Pareto-efficient Nash Equilibrium state.},

abstract={This paper studies spectrum sharing for providing better quality of experience in 5G networks, which are characterized by multidimensional heterogeneity in terms of spectrum, cells, and user requirements. Specifically, spectrum access, power allocation, and user scheduling are jointly investigated and an optimization problem is formulated with the objective of maximizing the users' satisfaction across the network. In order to reduce the complexity and overhead, decentralized solutions with local information are required. To this end, we employ game-theoretic approach and interference graph to solve the problem. The proposed game is proved to have at least one Nash Equilibrium (NE), corresponding to either the globally or locally optimal solution to the original optimization problem. A concurrent best-response iterative algorithm is first devised to find the solution, which can converge to an NE, but may not be globally optimal. Therefore, a spatial adaptive play iterative (SAPI) learning algorithm is further proposed to search the global optimum. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the SAPI algorithm can guarantee to find the globally optimal solution with an arbitrary large probability, when the learning step is set to be sufficiently large. Simulation results are provided to validate the performance of the proposed algorithms.},

abstract={In this paper, we deal with the problem of opportunistic spectrum access in infrastructure-less cognitive networks. Each secondary user (SU) Tx is allowed to select one frequency channel at each transmission trial. We assume that there is no information exchange between SUs, and they have no knowledge of channel quality, availability, and other SUs actions, hence, each SU selfishly tries to select the best band to transmit. This particular problem is designed as a multi-user restless Markov multi-armed bandit problem, in which multiple SUs collect a priori unknown reward by selecting a channel. The main contribution of the paper is to propose an online learning policy for distributed SUs, that takes into account not only the availability criterion of a band but also a quality metric linked to the interference power from the neighboring cells experienced on the sensed band. We also prove that the policy, named distributed restless QoS-UCB, achieves at most logarithmic order regret, for a single-user in a first time and then for multi-user in a second time. Moreover, studies on the achievable throughput, average bit error rate obtained with the proposed policy are conducted and compared to well-known reinforcement learning algorithms.},

year={2016},

pages={100-108}, 
abstract={In a cognitive radio (CR) network, a secondary user learns the spectrum environment and dynamically accesses the channel where the primary user is inactive. At the same time, a primary user emulation (PUE) attacker can send falsified primary user signals and prevent the secondary user from utilizing the available channel. Although there is a large body of work on PUE attack detection and defending strategies, the best attacking strategies that an attacker can apply have not been well studied. In this paper, for the first time, we study the optimal PUE attack strategies without any prior knowledge on the primary user activity characteristics and the secondary user access strategies. We formulate the problem as a non-stochastic online learning problem where the attacker needs to dynamically decide the attacking channel in each time slot based on its attacking experience in previous slots. The challenge in our problem is that the PUE attacker cannot observe the reward on the attacked channel because it never knows if a secondary user ever tries to access it. To solve this challenge, we propose an attack-but-observe-another (ABOA) scheme, in which the attacker attacks one channel in the spectrum sensing phase, but observes at least one other channel in the data transmission phase. We propose two non-stochastic online learning-based attacking algorithms, EXP3-DO and OPT-RO, which select the observing channel deterministically based on the attacking channel and uniform randomly, respectively. EXP3-DO employs an existing theoretical framework and is suboptimal. OPT-RO is based on the new proposed theoretical framework and is optimal. They achieve regret in the order of O(T2/3) and O(√T), respectively. T is the number of slots the CR network operates. We also generalize OPT-RO to multichannel observation cases. We show consistency between simulation and analytical results under various system parameters.},

In this work, we propose a joint link-channel selection and rate allocation algorithm (LCR) concerning to mitigate network interference and congestion to raise overall network throughput. The LCR greedily finds suitable channel allocations over forwarding links through perception based spectrum-learning method and allocate desired minimum rate (and power) over forwarding links to minimize traffic backlog. Thus, it reduces interference, allows more concurrent transmissions and boosts up overall network throughput. The simulation results, carried out in ns-3, demonstrate that the proposed LCR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art works in terms of throughput and reliability performances.},

To solve this game, we propose a regret-based learning (RBL) dynamic duty cycle selection (DDCS) method for configuring the transmission gaps in LTE-U UABSs, to ensure a satisfactory throughput for all users. Simulation results show that the proposed RBL-DDCS yields an improvement of 32% over fixed duty cycle LTE-U transmission, and an improvement of 10% over Q-learning based DDCS.},

abstract={Thanks to the rapid development of information technology, the size of a wireless network is becoming larger and larger, which makes spectrum resources more precious than ever before. To improve the efficiency of spectrum utilization, game theory has been applied to study efficient spectrum sharing for a long time. However, the scale of wireless networks in existing studies is relatively small. In this paper, we introduce a novel game called aggregative game and use it to model spectrum sharing in large-scale, heterogeneous, and dynamic networks. Meanwhile, the massive usage of the spectrum leads to easier divulgence of privacy of spectrum users, which calls for privacy and truthfulness guarantees. In a large decentralized scenario, each user has no priori about other users' channel access decisions, which forms an incomplete information game. A “weak mediator,” e.g., the base station or licensed spectrum regulator, is introduced and it turns the incomplete spectrum sharing game into a complete one. This is essential in reaching a Nash equilibrium (NE). By utilizing past channel access experience, we propose an online learning algorithm to improve the utility of each user. We show that the learning algorithm achieves an NE over time and provides no regret guarantee for each user. Specifically, our mechanism admits an approximate ex-post NE, and is joint differentially private and incentive-compatible. Efficiency of the approximate NE is evaluated, and innovative scaling law results are disclosed. We also provide simulation results to verify our analysis.},

abstract={We propose a flexible framework for spectral conversion (SC) that facilitates training with unaligned corpora. Many SC frameworks require parallel corpora, phonetic alignments, or explicit frame-wise correspondence for learning conversion functions or for synthesizing a target spectrum with the aid of alignments. However, these requirements gravely limit the scope of practical applications of SC due to scarcity or even unavailability of parallel corpora. We propose an SC framework based on variational auto-encoder which enables us to exploit non-parallel corpora. The framework comprises an encoder that learns speaker-independent phonetic representations and a decoder that learns to reconstruct the designated speaker. It removes the requirement of parallel corpora or phonetic alignments to train a spectral conversion system. We report objective and subjective evaluations to validate our proposed method and compare it to SC methods that have access to aligned corpora.},

abstract={In spectrum overlay cognitive wireless networks, when the secondary users are blind, i.e. have no prior knowledge of primary users' activities, a major question remains as to what strategy to adopt to learn the primary state information online while sensing the spectrum for exploiting idle bands. To maximize secondary network spectral utilization while minimizing interference and collision, requires searching for a balance between choosing empirically best channel while investigating other channels for potential opportunities. Moreover, competition should also be resolved to prevent congestion and collision among secondary users who tend to access the same idle channel. In this paper, by compressing the inessential exploration phase, we first propose an asymptotically optimal, fast-converging channel selection algorithm referred to as modified-myopic strategy for the single-user scenario based on the result of multi-armed bandit. Through analysis and simulation modeling, we evaluate the performance of our approach and compare it to that of other strategies in the literature. Next we adopt a game-theoretic model and extend our algorithm to design a fair and low-complexity access strategy for multi-user case based on a generalized CSMA/CA scheme. Finally, we show the improved efficiency of the proposed approach, in particular significantly enhanced for dense networks.},

abstract={Offloading the LTE data services to unlicensed spectrum has been considered by 3GPP in Release 13, which is defined as LAA (Licensed-Assisted Access). Unlicensed band is attractive because of its large amount of spectrum resource. However, coexisting with wireless devices already existing in unlicensed spectrum (such as Wi-Fi) is a primary issue be solved effectively. This paper proposed two dynamic max TxOP (transmission opportunity) algorithms based on Q-learning and expected capacity while inheriting the application of LBT(Listen-before-Talk), CCA-ED(channel clear assessment-energy detection) and discontinuous transmission. Using this framework, both LTE and Wi-Fi adjust the maximum occupancy time based on current traffic load or expected capacity dynamically, in order to improve the two systems' performance by configuring the transmission opportunity more reasonablely. Simulation results also show that the proposed approaches can enhance throughput and fairness significantly under both low and high traffic load, proving that the proposed dynamic TxOP algorithms offer new possibilities for better coexistence performance in LAA system.},

abstract={In order to fully utilise limited spectrum resources of multiple channels and multiple radios in cognitive radio networks, the authors propose a potential game model for opportunistic spectrum access based on both accurate and inaccurate spectrum state estimation with considering the interference constraints of licensed users. Three algorithms are proposed to achieve equilibrium of the proposed game. First, assuming spectrum sensing results are accurate, a joint strategy fictitious play-based channel selection algorithm with incomplete information is presented, and it can achieve a pure Nash equilibrium (NE) of the proposed game. Second, in order to make the outcomes of game robust, an evolutionary spectrum access mechanism with complete information is introduced by using evolutionary game theory based on inaccurate spectrum state estimation so that evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) can be achieved. Finally, with incomplete network information, a distributed learning algorithm is proposed to achieve a mixed NE, which is proved to be an ESS.

abstract={This paper investigates the problem of distributed spectrum access for cognitive small cell networks. Compared with existing work, two inherent features are considered: i) the transmission of a cognitive small cell base station only interferes with its neighbors due to the low power, i.e., the interference is local, and ii) the channel state is time-varying due to fading. We formulate the problem as a robust graphical game, and prove that it is an ordinal potential game which has at least one pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE). Also, the lower throughput bound of NE solutions is analytically obtained. To cope with the dynamic and incomplete information constraints, we propose a distribute spectrum access algorithm to converge to some stable results.

abstract={Uplink-downlink decoupling in which users can be associated to different base stations in the uplink and downlink of heterogeneous small cell networks (SCNs) has attracted significant attention recently. However, most existing works focus on simple association mechanisms in LTE SCNs that operate only in the licensed band. In contrast, in this paper, the problem of resource allocation with uplink-downlink decoupling is studied for an SCN that incorporates LTE in the unlicensed band. Here, the users can access both licensed and unlicensed bands while being associated to different base stations. This problem is formulated as a noncooperative game that incorporates user association, spectrum allocation, and load balancing. To solve this problem, a distributed algorithm based on the machine learning framework of echo state networks (ESNs) is proposed. This proposed algorithm allows the small base stations to autonomously choose their optimal resource allocation strategies given only limited information on the network's and users' states. It is shown that the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary mixed-strategy distribution, which constitutes a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for their studied game. Simulation results show that the proposed approach yields significant gain, in terms of the sum-rate of the 50th percentile of users, that reaches up to 167% compared with a Q-learning algorithm. The results also show that the ESN significantly provides a considerable reduction of information exchange for the wireless network.},

abstract={This article investigates the problem of distributed channel selection in opportunistic spectrum access networks from a perspective of interference minimization. The traditional physical (PHY)-layer interference model is for information theoretic analysis. When practical multiple access mechanisms are considered, the recently developed binary medium access control (MAC)-layer interference model in the previous work is more useful, in which the experienced interference of a user is defined as the number of competing users. However, the binary model is not accurate in mathematics analysis with poor achievable performance. Therefore, we propose a real-valued one called stochastic MAC-layer interference model, where the utility of a player is defined as a function of the aggregate weight of the stochastic interference of competing neighbors. Then, the distributed channel selection problem in the stochastic MAC-layer interference model is formulated as a weighted stochastic MAC-layer interference minimization game and we proved that the game is an exact potential game which exists one pure strategy Nash equilibrium point at least. By using the proposed stochastic learning-automata based uncoupled algorithm with heterogeneous learning parameter (SLA-H), we can achieve suboptimal convergence averagely and this result can be verified in the simulation. Moreover, the simulated results also prove that the proposed stochastic model can achieve higher throughput performance and faster convergence behavior than the binary one.},

pages={536-549}, 
abstract={Distributed spectrum access (DSA) is challenging, since an individual secondary user often has limited sensing capabilities only. One key insight is that channel recommendation among secondary users can help to take advantage of the inherent correlation structure of spectrum availability in both time and space, and enable users to obtain more informed spectrum opportunities. With this insight, we advocate to leverage the wisdom of crowds, and devise social recommendation aided DSA mechanisms to orient secondary users to make more intelligent spectrum access decisions, for both strong and weak network information cases. We start with the strong network information case where secondary users have the statistical information. To mitigate the difficulty due to the curse of dimensionality in the stochastic game approach, we take the one-step Nash approach and cast the social recommendation aided DSA decision making problem at each time slot as a strategic game. We show that it is a potential game, and then devise an algorithm to achieve the Nash equilibrium by exploiting its finite improvement property. For the weak information case where secondary users do not have the statistical information, we develop a distributed reinforcement learning mechanism for social recommendation aided DSA based on the local observations of secondary users only. Appealing to the maximum-norm contraction mapping, we also derive the conditions under which the distributed mechanism converges and characterize the equilibrium therein. Numerical results reveal that the proposed social recommendation aided DSA mechanisms can achieve a superior performance using real social data traces and its performance loss in the weak network information case is insignificant, compared with the strong network information case.},

It is assumed there is no prior information about the Primary Users (PUs) and other SUs activities while there is no information exchange among SUs. Each SU is empowered with an LA which operates in the RF environment with different responses. That is, the SUs are considered as agents in a self-organized system which select one channel as an action and receive different responses from the environment based on how much their selected actions are favorable or unfavorable. Using these responses, SUs control their accesses to the channels for appropriate spectrum management with the objective to incur less communication delay, less interference with PUs, and less interference with other SUs. The proposed LA-based distributed algorithm is investigated in terms of asymptotic convergence and stability. Simulation results are provided to show the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of SUs' waiting times, interference with other SUs, the number of interruptions by PUs during their transmissions, and fairness.},

abstract={The wireless sensor network (WSN) is one of the key enablers for the Internet of Things (IoT), where WSNs will play an important role in future internet by several application scenarios, such as healthcare, agriculture, environment monitoring, and smart metering. However, today's radio spectrum is very crowded for the rapid increasing popularities of various wireless applications. Hence, WSN utilizing the advantages of cognitive radio technology, namely, cognitive radio-based WSN (CR-WSN), is a promising solution for spectrum scarcity problem of IoT applications. A major challenge in CR-WSN is utilizing spectrum more efficiently. Therefore, a novel channel access scheme is proposed for the problem that how to access the multiple channels with the unknown environment information for cognitive users, so as to maximize system throughput. The problem is modeled as I.I.D. multi-armed bandit model with M cognitive users and N arms (M<;N). In order to solve the competition and the fairness between cognitive users of WSNs, a fair channel-grouping scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme divides these channels into M groups according to the water-filling principle based on the learning algorithm UCB-K index, the number of channels not less than one in each group and then allocate channel group for each cognitive user by using distributed learning algorithm fairly. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme cannot only effectively solve the problem of collision between the cognitive users, improve the utilization rate of the idle spectrum, and at the same time reflect the fairness of selecting channels between cognitive users.},

This paper first investigates the concept of LAA, which consists of four main functionalities: 1) carrier selection (CS); 2) listen-before-talk; 3) discontinuous transmission (DTX); and 4) transmit power control (TPC). Second, the LAA functionality implementation is provided using an open source LTE-A downlink link level simulator. Third, we devise an enhanced learning technique for CS and DTX for efficient coexistence among LTE-A and WiFi users. In particular, we provide a Q-learning mechanism for the advanced learning of the unlicensed band activity resulting in the efficient coexistence. Finally, we enhance the coexistence further through a double Q-learning method as a proposal for CS that takes into account both DTX and TPC improving both LTE and WiFi performance. Simulation results are provided for all the use cases that reveal the benefit of exploiting unlicensed bands in next generation mobile cellular networks.},

abstract={Technologies like Internet of things (IoT) not only push radio nodes to sense and hear wireless medium, but also provide opportunity to learn and adapt to radio neighborhood. With IoT envisioned to become new normal in our daily lives, spectrum scarcity and increased interference issues becomes non-trivial. As Wireless Local area networks (WLANs) like HiperLan from ETSI and 802.11 radios from IEEE are vital frontrunners to realize IoT technology, channel access algorithms at MAC layer play a vital role to attain maximum achievable throughput by managing spectrum and interference. Contention based, binary exponential back off CSMA/CA is default channel access mechanism for most 802.11 radios for sake of its simplicity and applicability in both ad-hoc and infrastructure modes. Even though contention free and polling based point coordinated function (PCF) is illustrated in IEEE 802.11 standards, it to be implemented along with distributed coordinated function (DCF), for adding new nodes to same channel. Time division multiple access (TDMA) based medium access layer (MAC) proposed for HiperLan by ETSI also implements RANDOM ACCESS PHASE to add new radios to channel. DCF, PCF and TDMA allow radios to access channel serially, as simultaneous parallel transmission by multiple radios can lead to collision because of Interference. In this paper a novel interference and spectrum aware channel access mechanism for WLANs, is proposed based on perceived RSSI, RCPI and SNR metrics and generating signal-strength-snr graph to allow multiple parallel transmissions possible in same channel.},

abstract={Because of opportunistic spectrum access, cognitive radio networks is a promising solution for spectrum scarcity problem. In cognitive radio networks, users need to communicate through control channels in order to cooperate for sharing sensing information, channel sharing and spectrum management. As a result control channels security is of a great importance. If control channels get jammed, network's performance degrades dramatically; therefore, the jammers primary target in cognitive radio networks is to demolish control channels in order to disturb the network's performance. Traditionally hopping sequences were used to battle this problem but considering cognitive radio networks intelligence, dynamic spectrum access and learning algorithms all can be hired to confront jammer. In this paper, by using game theoretic concepts, stochastic games and by defining states, actions and players' reward, we introduce a stochastic game with multiple users to make control channels resilient against sweep attacks. Win or Learn Fast (WoLF) Q learning algorithm has been used to solve the designed game and variable learning rate are used to make sure that the designed game converges. By simulation we show that in the presence of dynamic channel variations and imperfect sensing the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing ones in terms of jammer resistivity.},

pages={1-6}, 
abstract={Uplink-downlink decoupling in which users can be associated to different base stations in the uplink and downlink in heterogeneous small cell networks (SCNs) has attracted significant attention recently. However, most existing works focus on simple association mechanisms in LTE SCNs that operate only in the licensed band. In contrast, in this paper, the problem of resource allocation with uplink-downlink decoupling is studied for an SCN that incorporates LTE in the unlicensed band (LTE-U). Here, the users can access both licensed and unlicensed bands while being associated to different base stations. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem which jointly incorporates user association, spectrum allocation, and load balancing. To solve this problem, a distributed algorithm based on the machine learning framework of echo state networks is proposed using which the small base stations autonomously choose their optimal bands allocation strategies while having only limited information on the network's and users' states. Simulation results show that the proposed approach yields significant gains, in terms of total rate, that reach up to 41% and 54%, respectively, compared to Q-learning and nearest neighbor algorithms. The results also show that ESN significantly improves convergence time of up to 17% compared to Q-learning.},

To optimize its throughput, the SU sensing period has to be carefully tuned. However, in absence of the exact knowledge of PU activity statistics, under SaST, the PU's performance may be adversely affected. A learning strategy is devised to update the estimated statistics based on spectrum sensing observations. Simulation studies demonstrate that the resulting robust solution provides a good trade-off between optimizing the SU's throughput and protecting the PU.},

A centralized spectrum manager (SM) is responsible for assigning the heterogeneous requests from users to different spectrum fragments.

We formulate the above problem as a stochastic sequential decision-making problem, in which optimization goal is to maximize the cumulative average satisfaction of system. In order to solve the optimal problem, we divide dynamic spectrum allocation process into three stages which are reinforcement learning, real-time spectrum allocation and online adjusting respectively.

abstract={An optimal spectrum handoff scheme for cognitive radio networks (CRNs) is presented in this paper. This scheme has two novel features: 1) Hybrid rule-based priority queuing model: To overcome the limitations of preemptive resume priority and nonpreemptive resume priority (PRP/NPRP) queuing models, a hybrid queuing model with discretion rule is proposed to characterize the spectrum access priority among secondary users (SUs). This hybrid queuing model is then used to calculate the channel waiting time during spectrum handoff; and 2) Multiteacher apprentice learning: Unlike existing CRN cognition engine designs that focus on spectrum adaptation through SU self-learning (i.e., an SU learns how to adapt to the dynamic CRN environment by itself), we propose the concept of multiteacher knowledge transfer, wherein the multiple SUs that already have mature spectrum adaptation strategies share their knowledge with an inexperienced SU. Our simulation results show that the proposed new designs improve the spectrum handoff accuracy for the complex CRN environments.},

Unlike the conventional approaches, CCRN features both communicator and jamming nodes in a friendly coalition to take joint actions against hostile networking entities. In particular, this paper showcases hypothetical blue force and red force CCRNs and their competition for open spectrum resources. We present state-agnostic and stateful solution approaches based on the decision theoretic framework. The state-agnostic approach builds on multiarmed bandit to develop an optimal strategy that enables the exploratory-exploitative actions from sequential sampling of channel rewards. The stateful approach makes an explicit model of states and actions from an underlying Markov decision process and uses multiagent Q-learning to compute optimal node actions. We provide a theoretical framework for CCRN and propose new algorithms for both approaches. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithms outperform some of the most important algorithms known to date.},

abstract={The use of unlicensed spectrum for LTE Small Cells is gaining traction amongst cellular operators. The spectral efficiency of LTE systems in the unlicensed spectrum is limited by the stipulations for coexistence with other devices operating in the unlicensed spectrum. We present a hybrid scheduling algorithm for the Small Cells (SeNB) to access the unlicensed spectrum wherein each SeNB uses distributed reinforcement learning to schedule its transmission in a component carrier (CC) and periodically updates its utility metric based on the optimal resource allocation if the scheme were to be centralized. Since the computation of the centralized resource allocation has exponential complexity, we propose a greedy algorithm for the central scheduling. On a 3GPP calibrated System Level Simulator (SLS), our proposed hybrid scheduling achieves 40 % gains in throughput in the presence of both LTE and Wi-Fi access points (AP). Further, we demonstrate the utility of the distributed scheduling even for the licensed band that allows efficient use of the licensed spectrum for small cells with finite back-haul capacity.},

abstract={Designing efficient channel access schemes for wireless communications without any prior knowledge about the nature of environments has been a very challenging issue, in which the channel state distribution of all spectrum resources could be entirely or partially stochastic or adversarial at different times and locations. In this paper, we propose an online learning algorithm for adaptive channel access of wireless communications in unknown environments based on the theory of multiarmed bandits (MAB) problems. By automatically tuning two control parameters, i.e., learning rate and exploration probability, our algorithms could find the optimal channel access strategies and achieve the almost optimal learning performance over time in different scenarios. The quantitative performance studies indicate the superior throughput gain when compared with previous solutions and the flexibility of our algorithm in practice, which is resilient to both oblivious and adaptive jamming attacks with different intelligence and attacking strength that ranges from no-attack to the full-attack of all spectrum resources. We conduct extensive simulations to validate our theoretical analysis.},

abstract={For achieving optimized spectrum usage, most existing opportunistic spectrum sensing and access protocols model the spectrum sensing and access problem as a partially observed Markov decision process by assuming that the information states and/or the primary users' (PUs) traffic statistics are known a priori to the secondary users (SUs). While theoretically sound, the existing solutions may not be effective in practice due to two main concerns. First, the assumptions are not practical, as before the communication starts, PUs' traffic statistics may not be readily available to the SUs. Second and more serious, existing approaches are extremely vulnerable to malicious jamming attacks. By leveraging the same statistic information and stochastic dynamic decision-making process that the SUs would follow, a cognitive attacker with sensing capability can sense and jam the channels to be accessed by SUs, while not interfering PUs. To address these concerns, we formulate the antijamming, multichannel access problem as a nonstochastic multi-armed bandit problem. By leveraging probabilistically shared information between the sender and the receiver, our proposed protocol enables them to hop to the same set of channels with high probability while gaining resilience to jamming attacks without affecting PUs' activities. We analytically show the convergence of the learning algorithms and derive the performance bound based on regret. We further discuss the problem of tracking the best adaptive strategy and characterize the performance bound based on a new regret. Extensive simulation results show that the probabilistic spectrum sensing and access protocol can overcome the limitation of existing solutions and is highly resilient to various jamming attacks even with jammed acknowledgment (ACK) information.},

It is proven that the formulated spectrum access game is an exact potential game (EPG) with the aggregate interference level as the potential function, and the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the game corresponds to the global or local optima of the original optimization problem. A lower bound of the achievable aggregate interference level is rigorously derived. Finally, we propose an autonomous best response (BR) learning algorithm to converge toward its NE. It is shown that the proposed game-theoretic solution converges rapidly, and its achievable performance is close to the optimum solution.},

Furthermore, we present a novel Bayesian network based approach to theoretical analysis of RL based DSA. It explains a predicted improvement in the convergence behaviour achieved by DIAQ, compared to classical RL. The scheme is also assessed using large scale simulations of a stadium temporary event network. Compared to a typical heuristic ICIC approach, DIAQ provides significantly better quality of service and supports considerably higher network throughput densities. In addition, DIAQ dramatically improves initial performance, speeds up convergence, and improves steady state performance of a state-of-the-art distributed Q-learning algorithm, confirming the theoretical predictions. Finally, our scheme is designed to comply with the current LTE standards. Therefore, it enables easy implementation of robust distributed machine intelligence for full self-organisation in existing commercial networks.},

abstract={We propose a novel dynamic common-control-channel-based medium access control (DCCC-MAC) protocol for cellular (centralized) cognitive radio (CR) networks. Specifically, unlike the traditional dedicated-control-channel-based medium access control (MAC) protocols, the proposed MAC protocol eliminates the requirement of a dedicated channel for control information exchange. During a given transmission frame, the common control channel (CCC) is selected by a cooperating set of secondary users (SUs) by using a support-vector-machine (SVM)-based learning technique. In the DCCC-MAC protocol, the frame duration is divided into four main phases as follows: spectrum sensing, CCC selection, data transmission, and beaconing. The SUs that participate in the CCC selection process are allocated channels for data transmission during a frame interval using a scheduling process, whereas the other SUs have to contend to access the channels. We present an analytical approach to calculate the minimum required number of minislots in the transmission frame for a given number of SUs in the CCC selection process. The saturation throughput of the proposed MAC protocol is analyzed in closed form. To this end, the numerical and simulation results are presented to quantify the performance of the proposed DCCC-MAC protocol. We also compare the performance of the DCCC-MAC protocol with that of two other state-of-the-art CR MAC protocols that use CCCs.},

abstract={This paper presents end-to-end learning from spectrum data - an umbrella term for new sophisticated wireless signal identification approaches in spectrum monitoring applications based on deep neural networks. End-to-end learning allows to (i) automatically learn features directly from simple wireless signal representations, without requiring design of hand-crafted expert features like higher order cyclic moments, and (ii) train wireless signal classifiers in one end-to-end step which eliminates the need for complex multi-stage machine learning processing pipelines. The purpose of this article is to present the conceptual framework of end-to-end learning for spectrum monitoring and systematically introduce a generic methodology to easily design and implement wireless signal classifiers. Furthermore, we investigate the importance of the choice of wireless data representation to various spectrum monitoring tasks. In particular, two case studies are elaborated (i) modulation recognition and (ii) wireless technology interference detection. For each case study three convolutional neural networks are evaluated for the following wireless signal representations: temporal IQ data, the amplitude/phase representation and the frequency domain representation. From our analysis we prove that the wireless data representation impacts the accuracy depending on the specifics and similarities of the wireless signals that need to be differentiated, with different data representations resulting in accuracy variations of up to 29%. Experimental results show that using the amplitude/phase representation for recognizing modulation formats can lead to performance improvements up to 2% and 12% for medium to high SNR compared to IQ and frequency domain data, respectively. For the task of detecting interference, frequency domain representation outperformed amplitude/phase and IQ data representation up to 20%.},

The dramatically increase in data traffic and the demand for high data rates services in UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service) become a challenge that faces Mobile Operators due to the shortage of spectrum resources. Hence, to fulfill users' requirements with the current network resources, by the aid of data analytics technique like regression, a tool is being designed to comprehensively analyze the current cell Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that impact the average user throughput, afterwards it advises with the optimum resources utilization to achieve the required user throughput. Subsequently, it optimizes the mobility parameters to re-distribute and balance traffic among cells, which accordingly increases the overall network capacity, resources utilization and user throughput without any extra expenditures.},

abstract={Cognitive radios (CRs) mainly aim to reuse the spectrum holes in order to efficiently utilize the available scarce radio spectrum. However, current CRs techniques have a throughput limitation problem which ultimately limits telecommunication applications horizons nowadays. Moreover, achieving high throughput will overcome the bottleneck of CRs application limitations to the reporting and browsing applications only. To tackle this emerging throughput limitation issue in the CRs, this paper proposes the online greedy throughput maximization (OGTM) algorithm which overcomes the throughput limitations. OGTM allows the sensing cycle frame to have a variable length according to the assumed decision validity interval. Then, OGTM varies the decision validity interval of secondary users (SUs) based on the primary users (PUs) historical behavior. As a proof of concept, we developed a simulator in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed OGTM technique. The simulation results show that SUs benefit from the limited PU historical behavior learning, which resultantly increases the throughput up to 95% and at the same time decreases the miss detection probability by 50%.},

abstract={Recently, network traffic has been growing exponentially and almost reached the physical capacity limit of single mode fibers. Space division multiplexing (SDM) is a promising technology to overcome the looming fiber capacity crunch. Especially, few-mode multi-core fibers (FM-MCFs) can aggregate multiple cores into one fiber and two or more modes can be transmitted in one core, which can greatly increase the capacity yet introduce crosstalk constraints including inter- and intra- core crosstalk. To our best knowledge, there is no accurate crosstalk calculation model study in SDM optical networks with FM-MCFs. To address this issue, we first introduce the machine learning into the crosstalk prediction phase and propose a novel crosstalk estimation model exploiting the beam propagation method called CEMBPM- ML, which can be used to evaluate the crosstalk during the design for the resource allocation (RA) scheme. Then, a crosstalk aware core, mode, and spectrum assignment (CA-CMSA) strategy is presented. The simulation results for crosstalk estimation at the wavelength level indicate that the crosstalk at lower frequencies is less than that at higher frequencies. Thus, the lower frequencies are always the first choice in the spectrum resource assignment phase. In addition, for our specific training set, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm based on machine learning performs better on the training, including regression values measurement and time consumption. The simulation results of the proposed CA-CMSA scheme also show that the resource allocation algorithm based on Levenberg-Marquardt can improve resource utilization without increasing total connection set-up time. Thus, it will be the best choice for the resource assignment in SDM networks with FM-MCFs.},

abstract={Over the past decades, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has received unprecedented surge of scientific and military interest worldwide. This paper investigates the problem of opportunistic spectrum access for multi-UAV networks from a game-theoretic perspective. Due to the topology of the multi-UAV networks, the interference may be classified into two parts, i.e., the intra-cluster and the inter-cluster interference. Moreover, since the UAVs in the network have different tasks, the communication demand of each UAV should be taken into account. First, we formulate the demand-aware joint channel-slot selection problem as a weighted interference mitigation game, and then, design the utility function considering features of multi-UAV network, e.g., some rewards due to the channel and slots selection. We prove that the formulated game is an exact potential game with at least one pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. Next, we apply the distributed log-linear algorithm to achieve the desired optimization and overcome the constraint of dynamic communication demand of each UAV. To speed up the convergence, we also propose a low-complexity and realistic channel and slot initialization scheme for UAVs. Finally, the simulation results validate the effectiveness of the formulated game.},

pages={1-1}, 
abstract={Dynamic channel allocation (DCA) is the key technology to efficiently utilize the spectrum resources and decrease the co-channel interference for multibeam satellite systems. Most works allocate the channel on the basis of the beam traffic load or the user terminal distribution of the current moment. These greedy-like algorithms neglect the intrinsic temporal correlation among the sequential channel allocation decisions, resulting in the spectrum resources underutilization. To solve this problem, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based dynamic channel allocation (DRL-DCA) algorithm is proposed. Specifically, the DCA optimization problem, which aims at minimizing the service blocking probability, is formulated in multibeam satellite systems. Due to the temporal correlation property, the DCA optimization problem is modeled as the Markov decision process (MDP) which is the dominant analytical approach in DRL. In modeled MDP, the system state is reformulated into an image-like fashion, and then convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract useful features. Simulation results show that the DRL-DCA algorithm can decrease the blocking probability and improve the carried traffic and spectrum efficiency compared with other channel allocation algorithms.},

abstract={On-line monitoring and diagnosis of transformers have been investigated and discussed significantly in the last few decades. Vibration method is considered as one of the non-destructive and economical methods to explore transformer operating condition and evaluate transformer mechanical integrity and performance. However, transformer vibration and its evaluation criteria in transformer faulty condition are quite challenging and are not yet agreed upon. At the same time, with the advent of IoT facilities and services, it is expected that classical diagnosis techniques will be replaced with more powerful data-driven prognosis methods that can be used efficiently and effectively in smart monitoring. In this paper, we first discuss in detail an analytical approach to the transformer vibration modeling. Nevertheless, precise interpretation of transformer vibration signal through analytical models becomes unrealistic as higher harmonics are mixed with fundamental harmonics in vibration spectra. Therefore, as the next step, we aim to support the Industry 4.0 concept by utilizing the state-of-the-art machine learning and signal processing techniques to develop prognosis models of transformer operating condition based on vibration signals. Transformer turn-to-turn insulation deterioration and short circuit analysis as one the most important concerns in transformer operation is practically emulated and examined. Along with transformer short-circuit study, transformer over and under excitations are also studied and evaluated. Our constructed predictive models are able to detect transformer short-circuit fault in early stages using vibration signals before transformer catastrophic failure. Real-time information is transferred to the cloud system and results become accessible over any portable device.},

pages={12031-12043}, 
abstract={Sequential data, such as video frames and event data, have been widely applied in the realworld. As a special kind of sequential data, hyperspectral images (HSIs) can be regarded as a sequence of 2-D images in the spectral dimension, which can be effectively utilized for distinguishing different landcovers according to the spectral sequences. This paper presents a novel noise reduction method based on superpixel-based subspace low rank representation for hyperspectral imagery. First, under the framework of a linear mixture model, the original hyperspectral cube is assumed to be low rank in the spectral domain, which could be represented by decomposing HSI data into two sub-matrices of lower ranks. Meanwhile, due to the high correlation of neighboring pixels, the spectra within each neighborhood would also promote low rankness, and the local spatial low rankness could be exploited by enforcing the nuclear norm within superpixel-based regions in the decomposed subspace. The superpixels are easily and effectively generated by utilizing state-of-the-art superpixel segmentation algorithms in the first principal component of the original HSI. Moreover, benefiting from the subspace decomposition, the proposed method has an overwhelming superiority in computational cost than the state-of-the-art LR-based methods. The final model could be efficiently solved by the augmented Lagrangian method. Experimental results on simulated and real hyperspectral data sets validate that the proposed method produces superior performance than other stateof-the-art denoising methods in terms of quantitative assessment and visual quality.},

abstract={Cyber-physical-social system (CPSS) has drawn tremendous attention in industrial applications such as industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). As the fundamental component of IIoT, bearings play an increasingly important role in CPSS for IIoT. Better understanding of bearing working conditions and degradation patterns so as to more accurately predict the remaining useful life (RUL), becomes an urgent demand for industrial prognostics in IIoT. The data-driven approach has indicated good potential, but the prediction accuracy is still not satisfactory. This paper proposes a new method for the prediction of bearing RUL based on deep convolution neural network (CNN). A new feature extraction method is presented to obtain the eigenvector, named the spectrum-principal-energy-vector. The eigenvector is suitable for deep CNN. In the prediction phase, we propose a smoothing method to deal with the discontinuity problem found in the prediction results. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose such a smoothing method for bearing RUL prediction. Experiments show that our method can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of bearing RUL.},

We consider a scenario where users with different QoS requirements access to the Heterogeneous Network (HetNet) with coexisting Cellular-WiFi. In order to maximize network resource utilization in such a complex and dynamic environment, we exploit multi-agent reinforcement learning to perform RAT selection in conjunction with resource allocation for individual users based on sensing dynamic channel states and traffic characteristics. We first use Nash Q-learning to provide a set of feasible RAT access strategies, and then employ Monte-Carlo (MCTS) based Q-learning to perform resource allocation which tries to maximize system throughput while meeting traffic QoS requirements. Numerical results reveal that the network access capacity can be maximized while meeting traffic QoS requirements with limited number of searches by using our proposed SARA. Compared with traditional WiFi offloading schemes, SARA can significantly improve system resource utilization and capacity while guaranteeing QoS requirements of UEs.},

abstract={Remote Access Laboratories (RALs) have been used to develop experimental knowledge about practical engineering topics for a while. Distributed remote laboratories aim to share experiment among institutions and individuals through a distributed architecture. Experiments from diverse areas are combined as part of a larger system. Multiple control strategies are used to integrate experiments in Remote Laboratory Management Systems (RLMSs). This work defines two main categories to analyze the various implementations, white box and black box approaches. Experiments can be on a spectrum between these two extremes, sharing properties of both. When integrating an existing experiment into a new distributed RAL system, it is useful to evaluate the experiment with respect to its host or new RLMS for determining the best strategies to assimilate it. This paper provides a framework for such evaluation based on a number of properties of experiments. The proposed framework is called SHASS (Software, Hardware, Assessment, Support, and Share-ability) based on several factors such as the hardware used, the software to create the program, methods of sharing, user's support, and assessment of user's performance. It can be used to evaluate quality and identify options for improvements within an experiment's existing RLMS as well. Using this framework, a black box and white box approach are compared using two examples - federated and Peer-to-Peer RAL. The evaluation focuses on technical capabilities and development possibilities. A set of four experiments are also analysed to illustrate the utility of the framework in creating and improving experiments with respect to their RLMS.},

abstract={The interference alignment (IA) can increase the performance of the cognitive radio (CR) system by allowing multiple users to communicate simultaneously, in conjunction with the cognitive radio system. However, conventional IA-based CR researches do not meet the fundamental requirements of CR in the form of primary users participating in IA. In this paper, we allocate one SU as a sensor for sensing in the interference-based CR, and the remaining SUs are removed after being limited by the interference in the received signal space of the sensor. Then, a system is proposed in which the sensor can detect the signal of the PU in the remaining received signal space. In the proposed system, the sensor must determine the period of reporting the sensing results. For this, the reward is defined as interference ratio, loss ratio, and system load according to sensing result reply time. Using Q-learning, reinforcement learning, the sensing length and reporting period can be dynamically determined in an ever-changing environment. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has better performance in terms of interference ratio, loss ratio, and reward considering system load, compared to the case where the sensing length and reporting period are fixed at -12 dB.},

abstract={Sequential patterns are important, because they can be exploited to improve the prediction accuracy of our classifiers. Sequential data, such as time series/video frames, and event data are becoming more and more ubiquitous in a wide spectrum of application scenarios especially in the background of large data and deep learning. However, large data sets used in training modern machine-learning models, such as deep neural networks, are often affected by label noise. Existing noisy learning approaches mainly focus on building an additional network to clean the noise or find a robust loss function. Few works tackle this problem by exploiting sample correlations. In this paper, we propose BundleNet, a framework of sequential structure (named bundle-module, see Fig. 1) for deep neural networks to handle the label noise. The bundle module naturally takes into account sample correlations by constructing bundles of samples class-by-class, and treats them as independent inputs. Moreover, we prove that the bundle-module performs a form of regularization, which is similar to dropout as regularization during training. The regularization effect endows the BundleNet with strong robustness to the label noise. Extensive experiments on public data sets prove that the proposed approach is effective and promising.},

abstract={Wideband spectrum sensing is an important aspect of cognitive radio systems. In current models of wide spectrum sensing, a discrete frequency denotes a continuous frequency band. This type of model is divorced from practice and cannot reflect the reality of spectrum occupation. In this paper, we propose a novel wideband spectrum sensing scheme in terms of a modulated wideband converter (MWC) and sparse Bayesian learning (SBL). By exploiting the MWC, a practical wideband signal denoted by a block-sparse model is sampled to acquire the compressed measurements. We then employ SBL to directly extract the relevant information from the compressed measurements for estimating the support set. The estimated support set is chosen as the test statistic to facilitate spectrum sensing and analyze the detection performance. For applications in actual situations of support sets, different matching criteria are presented according to the requirements imposed by wideband spectrum sensing. Finally, we analyze the detection performance when a frequency band's location is given as well as when it is randomly generated by conducting simulations. These simulations show that the proposed method outperforms the MWC-based orthogonal matching pursuit method, and the best performance can be achieved under matching criterion 3.},

abstract={Cognitive radio (CR) enables unlicensed users to sense for and access underutilized licensed channels (or white spaces) owned by the licensed users in an opportunistic manner. Clustering segregates nodes in a network into logical groups called clusters. In CR networks (CRNs), larger cluster size improves network scalability thereby contributing to reduced routing overhead; however, it reduces cluster stability as the number of available common channels in a cluster reduces resulting in increased number of re-clusterings and clustering overhead. This paper presents our proposed first-of-its-kind cluster size adjustment scheme based on an artificial intelligence approach called reinforcement learning. The proposed scheme adapts the cluster size with the amount of white spaces as time goes by in order to improve network scalability and cluster stability in CRNs. Due to the lack of progress in the investigation of cluster size adjustment schemes in the literature, this paper also analyzes their attributes, and then presents such schemes investigated in various kinds of distributed wireless networks. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme improves network scalability by creating larger clusters, and improves cluster stability by reducing the number of re-clusterings (i.e., the number of cluster splits) and clustering overhead, while reducing interference between licensed and unlicensed users in CRNs.},

abstract={For a wireless avionics communication system, a Multi-arm bandit game is mathematically formulated, which includes channel states, strategies, and rewards. The simple case includes only two agents sharing the spectrum which is fully studied in terms of maximizing the cumulative reward over a finite time horizon. An Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm is used to achieve the optimal solutions for the stochastic Multi-Arm Bandit (MAB) problem. Also, the MAB problem can also be solved from the Markov game framework perspective. Meanwhile, Thompson Sampling (TS) is also used as benchmark to evaluate the proposed approach performance. Numerical results are also provided regarding minimizing the expectation of the regret and choosing the best parameter for the upper confidence bound.},

abstract={Spectrum trading is an important aspect of television white space (TVWS) and it is driven by the failure of spectrum sensing techniques. In spectrum trading, the primary users lease their unoccupied spectrum to the secondary users for a market fee. Although spectrum trading is considered as a reliable approach, it is confronted with a spectrum transaction completion time problem, which negatively impacts on end-users Quality of Service and Quality of Experience metrics. Spectrum transaction completion time is the duration to successfully conduct TVWS spectrum trading. To address this issue, this paper proposes simple mechanism auction reward truthful (SMART), a fast and iterative machine learning-assisted spectrum trading model to address this issue. Simulated results indicate that SMART out-performs referenced VERUM algorithm in three key performance indicators: bit-error rate, instantaneous throughput, and probability of dropped packets by 10%, 5%, and 15%, respectively.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network for thermal image enhancement by incorporating the brightness domain with a residual-learning technique, which improves the performance of enhancement and speed of convergence. Typically, the training domain uses the same domain as that of the target image; however, we evaluated several domains to determine the most suitable one for the network. In the analyses, we first compared the performance of networks that were trained by the corresponding regions of color-based and aligned infrared-based images, respectively, including thermal, far, and near spectra. Then, four RGB-based domains, namely, gray, lightness, intensity, and brightness were evaluated. Finally, the proposed network architecture was determined by considering the residual and brightness domains. The results of the analyses indicated that the brightness domain was the best training domain for enhancing the thermal images. The experimental results confirm that the proposed network, which can be trained in approximately one hour, outperforms the conventional learning-based approaches for thermal image enhancement, in terms of several image quality metrics and a qualitative evaluation. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the brightness domain is effective as the training domain and can be used to increase the performance of existing networks.},

The messages transmitted on the network are transmitted peer to peer in a multi-hop manner. Every device that joins the network can act both server and consumer roles. Each device also serves as a router. Peers participating in the network can learn the current state of the network from the device to which they are attached in the form of a tree structure. Thus, each peer learns the current structure of the network. At the same time, an algorithm was developed and implemented to spread the information of the newly added device to all correspondents on the network.

abstract={Collaborative spectrum sensing (CSS) enables secondary users in cognitive radio networks to collaboratively explore spectrum holes as well as protecting the primary user from being interfered. Unfortunately, the emergence of spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attack, also known as the Byzantine attack, brings significant threat to the reliability of the CSS. Majority of the existing studies on Byzantine defense can be divided into two categories: one is directly to make the judgment based on the current spectrum sensing data, while the other uses the historical spectrum sensing data to update sensors' reputation. The first category of studies does not take the historical spectrum sensing data into account, while most of the second category of studies are heuristic in nature. In this paper, we invoke Bayesian learning to design Byzantine defense schemes. First, we develop a Bayesian offline learning algorithm by considering one practical challenge that the ground-truth spectrum state is unavailable for training. Then, we develop a Bayesian online learning algorithm by considering the case that the sensors' attribute may be time-varying. In addition, we present simulations to show the performance of the proposed defence algorithms.},

The idea of the challenge was to invite teams to propose as diverse as possible solutions to a well defined problem, and evaluate the performance of the proposed solutions in a realistic environment. The challenge is defined to enable benchmarking and comparison of multiple teams, possibly working on different parts of the system, in a real environment. The winning solutions represented a complete and working system, working robustly and adapting to both anticipated scenario changes, as well as random effects caused by the conference setting. The code for running the challenge along with the winning solutions is publicly available, so that interested teams can start from the code when designing or benchmarking solutions, as well as when setting up own challenges and competitions. As a result, the challenge can serve as a milestone toward the creation of a benchmarking series. This paper contains all the necessary details about the software repositories so that it becomes possible to rerun the challenge and start building novel solutions based on the winners in IEEE DySPAN 2017.},

abstract={The CRN is a future generation wireless communication system that allows SUs to use the underutilized or unused spectrum, known as white spaces, in licensed spectrum with minimum interference to PUs. However, the dynamic conditions of CRNs (e.g., PUs' activities and channel availability) make routing more challenging compared to traditional wireless networks. In this tutorial, we focus on solving the routing problem in CRNs with the help of a clustering mechanism. Cluster-based routing in CRNs enhances network scalability by reducing the flooding of routing overheads, as well as network stability by reducing the effects of dynamicity of channel availability. Additionally, RL, an artificial intelligence approach, is applied as a tool to further enhance network performance. We present SMART, which is a cluster-based routing scheme designed for the CRN, and evaluate its performance via simulations in order to show the effectiveness of cluster- based routing in CRNs using RL.},

abstract={Periocular characteristics has gained substantial importance in recent times to supplement the performance of facial biometrics or as a stand-alone characteristics. While most of the current biometric systems for authentication or surveillance operate either in NIR spectrum or visible spectrum, the ocular information can be well utilized if a comparison of images from different spectra has to be conducted. In this work, we present a novel approach employing the features obtained from steerable pyramids to compare the ocular images captured from NIR versus the images captured from visible spectrum. The set of features obtained using the proposed cross-spectral approach are then used to learn a multi-class SVM classifier such that the probe image originating from another spectrum can be classified. Further, a fusion frame-work for combining the scores from different orientations of the steerable pyramid is proposed for a particular scale to strengthen the biometric performance of the algorithm. An extensive set of experiments conducted on a large database consisting of ocular images captured from 120 subjects (240 unique ocular instances) indicates the robustness of the proposed approach with a GMR of 100% at the FMR of 0.01% in a benchmark against other state-of-the-art techniques suggesting the applicability of proposed approach to greater extent.},

abstract={Feature-level fusion approaches for multispectral biometrics are mainly grouped into two categories: 1) concatenation and 2) elementwise multiplication. While concatenation of feature vectors has benefits in allowing all elements to interact, it is difficult to learn output classification. Differently, elementwise multiplication has the benefits in enabling multiplicative interaction, but it is difficult to learn input embedding. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to combine the benefits of both categories based on a compact representation of two feature vectors' outer product, which is called the multimodal compact multi-linear pooling technique. We first propose to expand the bilinear pooling technique for two inputs to a multi-linear technique to accommodate for multiple inputs (multiple inputs from multiple spectra are frequent in the multispectral biometric context). This fusion approach not only allows all elements to interact and enables multiplicative interaction, but also uses a small number of parameters and low computation complexity. Based on this fusion proposal, we subsequently propose a complete multispectral periocular recognition system. Employing higher order spectra features with an elliptical sampling approach proposed by Algashaam et al., our proposed system achieves the state-of-the-art performance in both our own and the IIIT multispectral periocular data sets. The proposed approach can also be extended to other biometric modalities.},

abstract={Knowledge about active radio transmitters is critical for multiple applications: spectrum regulators can use this information to assign spectrum, licensees can identify spectrum usage patterns and provision their future needs, and dynamic spectrum access applications can efficiently pick operating frequency. To achieve these goals, we need a system that continuously senses and characterizes the radio spectrum. Current measurement systems, however, do not scale overtime, frequency and space and cannot perform transmitter detection. We address these challenges with the Spectrum Observatory, an end-to-end system for spectrum measurement and characterization. This paper details the design and integration of the Spectrum Observatory, and describes and evaluates the first unsupervised method for detailed characterization of arbitrary transmitters called TxMiner. We evaluate TxMiner on real-world spectrum measurements collected by the Spectrum Observatory between 30 MHz and 6 GHz and show that it identifies transmitters robustly. Furthermore, we demonstrate the Spectrum Observatory's capabilities to map the number of active transmitters and their frequency and temporal characteristics, to detect rogue transmitters, and identify opportunities for dynamic spectrum access.},

abstract={Energy measurements have conventionally been used for detecting the presence of signal energy but not for distinguishing incumbent users (IUs). In this paper, soft and hard reports Gaussian mixture model learning algorithms are proposed to distinguish intermittently transmitting IUs and to find the footprints for each IU, i.e., the cognitive radio (CRs) that receive signals from each IU. Unlike existing methods for distinguishing IUs using single antenna CRs, the proposed methods do not require CR locations, channel models, or prior knowledge of the number of IUs or their protocol. The soft reports algorithm uses Mahalanobis distance to separate components while a two stage process learns components corresponding to individual IUs. The hard reports algorithm reduces computational complexity by learning unidimensional mixtures at each CR and fusing results using a novel algorithm for finding the maximum weight dominating set in a directed graph. MATLAB simulations of slotted ALOHA IU networks are used to evaluate the algorithms' performance as the number of CRs, IUs, and average activity are varied. In frequent collision scenarios, the soft reports algorithm has the best performance. However, NS3 simulations of 802.11n IU networks show that methods proposed to reduce false positives deteriorate detection performance due to channel capture effects.},

abstract={In this paper, an intelligent probing method for interference constraint learning is proposed to allow a centralized cognitive radio network (CRN) to access the frequency band of a primary user (PU) in an underlay cognitive communication scenario. The main idea is that the CRN probes the PU and subsequently eavesdrops the reverse PU link to acquire the binary ACK/NACK packet. This feedback is implicit channel state information of the PU link, indicating whether the probing-induced interference is harmful or not. The intelligence of this sequential probing process lies in the selection of the power levels of the secondary users, which aims to minimize the number of probing attempts, a clearly active learning (AL) procedure, and expectantly the overall PU QoS degradation. The enhancement introduced in this paper is that we incorporate the probability of each feedback being correct into this intelligent probing mechanism by using a multivariate Bayesian AL method. This technique is inspired by the probabilistic bisection algorithm and the deterministic cutting plane methods (CPMs). The optimality of this multivariate Bayesian AL method is proven and its effectiveness is demonstrated through numerical simulations. Computationally cheap CPM adaptations are also presented, which outperform existing AL methods.},

abstract={Wideband spectrum sensing aims to identify the occupied frequency bands. Conventional methods for single antenna spectrum sensors threshold the received power spectra to detect discrete frequency bins that are occupied. However, such methods neither group bins that are occupied by the same signal nor aggregate occupied bins over time to learn distinct frequency bands occupied by intermittently transmitting signals. This paper demonstrates a method to learn the frequency bands occupied by intermittently transmitting incumbent radios that occupy adjacent frequency bands without a guard band, such as by LTE-Advanced, or are spectrally overlapping, such as by IEEE 802.11. It formulates the wideband sensing problem as the factorization of a matrix consisting of multiple power spectrum measurements. A novel extreme ray based non-negative matrix factorization algorithm estimates the noise power spectrum and also determines the received power spectrum of the incumbent radios. Energy detection and a combinatorial algorithm is used to determine the unique supports of the received signals. Using a USRP N210 software defined radio as a receiver, we demonstrate that this algorithm can determine the frequency bands occupied by nearby transmitters in the 2.4GHz ISM band. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the algorithm learns the power spectrum of the colored noise experienced by the USRP.},

abstract={The abundant spectrum at millimeter-wave (mmWave) has the potential to greatly increase the capacity of 5G cellular systems. However, to overcome the high pathloss in the mmWave frequencies, beamforming with large antenna arrays is required at both the base station and user equipments for sufficient link budget. This feature is a challenge for beamforming training during initial access due to low SNR and poor synchronization. A recently developed compressive sensing (CS) based training algorithm exploits channel sparsity but it is vulnerable to phase error from poor synchronization. We propose a novel CS-based algorithm that tracks and compensates frequency offset and phase noise. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves achievable rate by 10 times compared with existing CS-based method during initial beamforming training.},

pages={298-304}, 
abstract={Self-Organizing Networks (SONs) are being researched extensively in the existing 3G and 4G landscape primarily to facilitate a convenient yet cost-effective approach in the configuration, optimization and troubleshooting of networks. However, the existing SONs will be no match for the operational complexity of the envisioned 5G networks. The promise of 5G revolves around the premise of infinite capacity and zero latency. 5G networks are set for commercial availability by 2020 and these networks will be part of a flexible and dynamic telecom ecosystem supporting cross-domain integration and multi-RAT environments. Network Densification, Network Function Virtualization, Flexible spectrum allocation, E2E security and Massive MTC are a few of the features promised by 5G networks. With this assortment of numerous technologies, it is obvious that SONs have to evolve beyond the existing reactive paradigm without which the maintenance and management of 5G networks would prove to be a herculean task. Hence, we propose a novel Proactive SON methodology based on the Big Data framework to enable the shift in the SON paradigm. In this article we present a comprehensive Big-Data based SON framework involving innovative Machine Learning techniques which would cater to scalability and programmability of 5G networks with respect to availability, reliability, speed, capacity, security and latency.},

pages={4747-4758}, 
abstract={This paper is focused on training sequence design for efficient channel estimation in multiple-input multiple-output filterbank multicarrier (MIMO-FBMC) communications using offset quadrature amplitude modulation (OQAM). MIMO-FBMC is a promising technique to achieve high spectrum efficiency as well as strong robustness against dispersive channels due to its feature of time-frequency localization. A salient drawback of FBMC/OQAM signals is that only real-field orthogonality can be kept, leading to the intrinsic imaginary interference being a barrier for high-performance channel estimations. Also, conventional channel estimations in the MIMO-FBMC systems mostly suffer from high training overhead especially for large number of transmit antennas. Motivated by these problems, in this paper, we propose a new class of training sequences, which are formed by concatenation of two identical zero-correlation zone sequences whose auto-correlation and cross correlation are zero within a time-shift window around the in-phase position. Since only real-valued symbols can be transmitted in MIMO-FBMC systems, we propose “complex training sequence decomposition (CTSD)” to facilitate the reconstruction of the complex-field orthogonality of MIMO-FBMC signals. Our simulations validate that the proposed CTSD is an efficient channel estimation approach for practical preamble-based MIMO-FBMC systems.},

abstract={A cognitive radio system has the ability to observe and learn from the environment, adapt to the environmental conditions, and use the radio spectrum more efficiently. However, due to multipath fading, shadowing, and varying channel conditions, uncertainty affects the cognitive cycle processes, measurements, decisions, and actions. In the observing process, measurements (i.e., information) taken by the secondary users are uncertain. In the next step, the secondary users make decisions based on what has already been observed using their knowledge bases, which may have been impacted by uncertainty. This can lead to the wrong decisions, and, thus the cognitive radio system can take the wrong actions. Hence, uncertainty propagation influences the cognitive radio performance. Therefore, mitigating uncertainty in the cognitive cycle is a necessity. This paper provides a deep overview of techniques that handle uncertainty in cognitive radio networks.},

Since in the CR network, the licensed users are easily be affected by the introduce of the unlicensed user, we have to avoid to bring the interference to the licensed users when the unlicensed users try to transmit the data on the licensed radio spectrum. It is very difficult to solve this problem especially when the licensed users are mobile. The situation becomes even worse when the distribution of the licensed users is unknown. In this paper, in order to improve the throughput under the mobile network, we propose a novel algorithm which combines the random forest to decrease the interference of the unlicensed user to the licensed users, thus, the network throughput can be dramatically improved.

abstract={Multimedia or spoken content presents more attractive information than plain text content, but the former is more difficult to display on a screen and be selected by a user. As a result, accessing large collections of the former is much more difficult and time-consuming than the latter for humans. It's therefore highly attractive to develop machines which can automatically understand spoken content and summarize the key information for humans to browse over. In this endeavor, a new task of machine comprehension of spoken content was proposed recently. The initial goal was defined as the listening comprehension test of TOEFL, a challenging academic English examination for English learners whose native languages are not English. An Attention-based Multi-hop Recurrent Neural Network (AMRNN) architecture was also proposed for this task, which considered only the sequential relationship within the speech utterances. In this paper, we propose a new Hierarchical Attention Model (HAM), which constructs multi-hopped attention mechanism over tree-structured rather than sequential representations for the utterances. Improved comprehension performance robust with respect to ASR errors were obtained.},

Many machine learning regression models including Support Vector Regression and Abductive Networks have been applied to this problem, but this paper studies the concept of ensemble method for improving the forecasting accuracy. Specifically, a cooperative ensemble training strategy using two optimization algorithms is proposed to train a Neural Network model. The trained model is characterized with good forecasting performance due to the exchange of experience and knowledge of the two optimization algorithm during the training process. A dataset consisting of 44160 recordings of hourly High-Speed Data Packet Access (HSDPA) data traffic, which was collected over a period of 30 days from sixty different sites of a UMTS-based cellular operator was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results show the superiority of the Neural Network model trained with the proposed ensemble training strategy over other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={Multilevel spin toque transfer RAM (STT-RAM) is a suitable storage device for energy-efficient neural network accelerators (NNAs), which relies on large-capacity on-chip memory to support brain-inspired large-scale learning models from conventional artificial neural networks to current popular deep convolutional neural networks. In this paper, we investigate the application of multilevel STT-RAM to general-purpose NNAs. First, the error-resilience feature of neural networks is leveraged to tolerate the read/write reliability issue in multilevel cell STT-RAM using approximate computing. The induced read/write failures at the expense of higher storage density can be effectively masked by a wide spectrum of NN applications with intrinsic forgiveness. Second, we present a precision-tunable STT-RAM buffer for the popular general-purpose NNA. The targeted STT-RAM memory design is able to transform between multiple working modes and adaptable to meet the varying quality constraint of approximate applications. Lastly, the reconfigurable STT-RAM buffer not only enables precision scaling in NNA but also provides adaptiveness to the demand for different learning models with distinct working-set sizes. Particularly, we demonstrate the concept of capacity/precision-tunable STT-RAM memory with the emerging reconfigurable deep NNA and elaborate on the data mapping and storage mode switching policy in STT-RAM memory to achieve the best energy efficiency of approximate computing.},

abstract={Due to the scarcity of the licensed spectrum allocated for mobile communication systems, licensed-assisted access long-term evolution (LAA-LTE) network is recently proposed to deploy in unlicensed spectrum, which is currently occupied by different Wi-Fi systems. It is a very challenging problem to ensure fair coexistence between LAA-LTE and Wi-Fi networks, in terms of spectrum sharing and traffic management. To solve this problem, a fair downlink traffic management (FDTM) scheme is proposed in this paper for hybrid LAA-LTE/Wi-Fi networks. FDTM aims to tune the minimum contention window (CWmin) values and assigns feasible weights for the LAA eNBs with different traffic loads, thus to achieve; 1) fair spectrum sharing with the coexisting Wi-Fi networks in unlicensed spectrum and 2) fair service differentiation for downlink LAA-LTE traffic. Numerical results show our FDTM scheme can guarantee the throughput performance of Wi-Fi networks in shared unlicensed spectrum while supporting proportional fairness for the LAA eNBs with different traffic loads.},

abstract={A novel digital predistortion (DPD) technique based on single loop feedback, nonlinear auto-regressive moving average (NARMA) structure is presented. The distinctive characteristics of this DPD is its straightforward deduction from the NARMA model of the power amplifier (PA) characteristics to be linearized, and the direct learning approach used to identify the DPD function. Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse technique is used to calculate the least mean square solutions, and it's performance is also reported. The proposed DPD technique is tested and validated on a 12 Watt Doherty power amplifier (DPA), with Long Term Evolution (LTE), and multicarrier Wideband Code Division Multiplexing Access (WCDMA) signals at 2.4 GHz. Simulation and experimental results show that such DPD is able to assure the linearity requirements of LTE and WCDMA standards by reducing the Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR) level at DPA output, from -35dBc to -50dBc relative to the carrier, and the Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) reduced from 24.6% to 1.6%. Moreover, a comparative study between the proposed DPD technique and Memory Polynomial DPD (MP-DPD) has also been carried out. The experimental comparison demonstrates the superior performance of the novel DPD formulation with respect to MP-DPD achieving an improvement of 6 dBc and 12 percentage points in ACPR and EVM, respectively.},

The dataset was validated using baseline signal analysis methods, with which classification performance was evaluated for each modality and a combination of both modalities. As already shown in previous literature, the capability of discriminating different mental states can be enhanced by using a hybrid approach, when comparing to single modality analyses. This makes the provided data highly suitable for hybrid BCI investigations.

Each solution was run two times and ranked using a single metric. Between the two runs the teams were allowed to improve their solution. The metric considered wanted throughput and unwanted interference. In addition to the metric, all solutions were evaluated by a jury.

abstract={In this paper, a centralized power control (PC) scheme and an interference channel learning method are jointly tackled to allow a cognitive radio network (CRN) access to the frequency band of a primary user (PU) operating based on an adaptive coding and modulation protocol. The learning process enabler is a cooperative modulation and coding classification (MCC) technique which estimates the modulation and coding scheme of the PU. Due to the lack of cooperation between the PU and the CRN, the CRN exploits this multilevel MCC sensing feedback as implicit channel state information of the PU link in order to constantly monitor the impact of the aggregated interference it causes. In this paper, an algorithm is developed for maximizing the CRN throughput (the PC optimization objective) and simultaneously learning how to mitigate PU interference (the optimization problem constraint) by using only the MCC information. Ideal approaches for this problem setting with high convergence rate are the cutting plane methods (CPM). Here, we focus on the analytic center CPM and the center of gravity CPM whose effectiveness in the proposed simultaneous PC and interference channel learning algorithm is demonstrated through numerical simulations.},

pages={6304-6324}, 
abstract={Cognitive radio (CR) enables unlicensed users to explore and exploit underutilized licensed channels (or white spaces). While multi-hop CR network has drawn significant research interest in recent years, majority work has been validated through simulation. A key challenge in multi-hop CR network is to select a route with high quality of service (QoS) and lesser number of route breakages. In this paper, we propose three route selection schemes to enhance the network performance of CR networks, and investigate them using a real testbed environment, which consists of universal software radio peripheral and GNU radio units. Two schemes are based on reinforcement learning (RL), while a scheme is based on spectrum leasing (SL). RL is an artificial intelligence technique, whereas SL is a new paradigm that allows communication between licensed and unlicensed users in CR networks. We compare the route selection schemes with an existing route selection scheme in the literature, called highest-channel (HC), in a multi-hop CR network. With respect to the QoS parameters (i.e., throughput, packet delivery ratio, and the number of route breakages), the experimental results show that RL approaches achieve a better performance in comparison with the HC approach, and also achieve close to the performance achieved by the SL approach.},

year={2016}, 
volume={64}, 
number={11}, 
pages={3501-3517}, 
abstract={Noncontiguous transmission schemes combined with high power-efficiency requirements pose big challenges for radio transmitter and power amplifier (PA) design and implementation. Due to the nonlinear nature of the PA, severe unwanted emissions can occur, which can potentially interfere with neighboring channel signals or even desensitize the own receiver in frequency division duplexing transceivers. In this paper, to suppress such unwanted emissions, a low-complexity subband digital predistortion solution, specifically tailored for spectrally noncontiguous transmission schemes in low-cost devices, is proposed. The proposed technique aims at mitigating only the selected spurious intermodulation distortion components at the PA output, hence allowing for substantially reduced processing complexity compared with classical linearization solutions. Furthermore, novel decorrelation-based parameter learning solutions are also proposed and formulated, which offer reduced computing complexity in parameter estimation as well as the ability to track time-varying features adaptively. Comprehensive simulation and RF measurement results are provided, using a commercial LTE-Advanced mobile PA, to evaluate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution in real-world scenarios. The obtained results demonstrate that highly efficient spurious component suppression can be obtained using the proposed solutions.},

abstract={Available radio resources in a wireless communication network are normally shared among multiple users. The state during which the number of users admitted into a network exceeds the capacity of the network is known as network congestion. Network congestion causes degradation of Quality of Service (QoS) and Grade of Service (GoS), which results in users' dissatisfaction. Thus, it is of uttermost importance to proactively prevent network congestion. Call Admission Control (CAC) is a radio resource management (RRM) technique that can be employed to prevent network congestion, thereby ensuring the GoS/QoS of admitted calls. In addition to preventing network congestion and ensuring QoS/GoS, it is sometimes necessary to meet other network or users' requirements. This survey outlines different call admission control schemes used to achieve specific objectives for different deployment scenarios.},

We cluster these feature vectors, representing an image as a normalized histogram of membership to various clusters, thereby creating a bag-of-visual-words model. We conduct a multiphase training, first performing a fast Multinomial Naïve Bayes learning, and subsequently using a pyramid-up topology to use the top k% results (based upon confidence scores) thus predicted and perform Dense SIFT for nearest neighbor matching. Contrary to traditional ocular biometric systems, our proposed approach does not rely highly accurate iris pattern segmentation, allowing less constrained image acquisition conditions such as from mobile devices.

abstract={X-Ray fluorescence (XRF) scanning of works of art is becoming an increasingly popular non-destructive analytical method. The high quality XRF spectra is necessary to obtain significant information on both major and minor elements used for characterization and provenance analysis. However, there is a trade-off between the spatial resolution of an XRF scan and the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of each pixel's spectrum, due to the limited scanning time. In this paper, we propose an XRF image super-resolution method to address this trade-off, thus obtaining a high spatial resolution XRF scan with high SNR. We use a sparse representation of each pixel using a dictionary trained from the spectrum samples of the image, while imposing a spatial smoothness constraint on the sparse coefficients. We then increase the spatial resolution of the sparse coefficient map using a conventional super-resolution method. Finally the high spatial resolution XRF image is reconstructed by the high spatial resolution sparse coefficient map and the trained spectrum dictionary.},

abstract={Due to the directionality of transmissions in millimeter wave (mm-wave) networks, wireless stations are usually unable to overhear when other stations access the channel. This makes it hard to design efficient distributed beam coordination and scheduling mechanisms. At the same time, centralized schemes only perform well in relatively simple, static scenarios. In practical settings where links have different channel qualities and in the context of relaying or in-band backhauling, centrally coordinating all stations becomes difficult. In this paper, we propose a low complexity, decentralized, learning-based scheduling algorithm for mm-wave networks that handles heterogeneous link rates and packet sizes efficiently. Compared to state-of-the-art slotted channel access for mm-wave networks, the proposed mechanism achieves throughput gains of up to a factor of 8 in single-hop scenarios and end-to-end throughput improvements of up to a factor of 1.6 in multi-hop topologies.},

abstract={Wireless Gigabit (WiGig) access points (APs) using 60 GHz unlicensed frequency band are considered as key enablers for future Gbps WLANs. Due to its short range transmission with high susceptibility to path blocking, a multiple number of WiGig APs should be installed to fully cover a typical target environment. However, using autonomously operated WiGig APs with IEEE 802.11ad DCF, the exhaustive search analog beamforming and the maximum received power based autonomous users association prevent the establishment of optimal WiGig concurrent links that maximize the total system throughput in random access scenarios. In this paper, we formulate the problem of WiGig concurrent transmissions in random access scenarios as an optimization problem, then we propose a Wi-Fi/WiGig coordination architecture to solve it. The proposed coordinated Wi-Fi/WiGig WLAN is based on a tight coordination between the 5 GHz (Wi-Fi) and the 60 GHz (WiGig) unlicensed frequency bands. By which, the wide coverage Wi-Fi band controls the establishment of the WiGig concurrent links. Statistical learning using Wi-Fi fingerprinting is used for estimating the best candidate AP and its best beam identification (ID) for establishing the WiGig concurrent link without making any interference to the existing WiGig data links.},

abstract={A magnetic field sensor using fiber ring cavity laser based on magnetic fluid (MF) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. MF-coated single-mode-no-core-singlemode fiber structure is inserted in the fiber ring laser cavity, which acts as a bandpass filter and the magnetic field sensing component simultaneously. The excellent bandpass filtering with a high side-mode suppression ratio (14 dB) and small insert loss of around (-1.03 dB) is caused by the self-imaging effect. The experimental results show that the lasing wavelength shifts to blue side with the increase of external magnetic field. The magnetic field sensing sensitivity of 12.05 pm/Oe is achieved within the range of 15.9-222.32 Oe. This configuration exhibits obvious advantages in term of high visibility (~40 dB) and relative narrow 3-dB bandwidth (~0.19 nm) of the lasing output spectrum. Therefore, its Q value is more than 10 times larger than those of other reported magnetic field sensing structures.},

abstract={This paper presents end-to-end learning from spectrum data - an umbrella term for new sophisticated wireless signal identification approaches in spectrum monitoring applications based on deep neural networks. End-to-end learning allows to (i) automatically learn features directly from simple wireless signal representations, without requiring design of hand-crafted expert features like higher order cyclic moments, and (ii) train wireless signal classifiers in one end-to-end step which eliminates the need for complex multi-stage machine learning processing pipelines. The purpose of this article is to present the conceptual framework of end-to-end learning for spectrum monitoring and systematically introduce a generic methodology to easily design and implement wireless signal classifiers. Furthermore, we investigate the importance of the choice of wireless data representation to various spectrum monitoring tasks. In particular, two case studies are elaborated (i) modulation recognition and (ii) wireless technology interference detection. For each case study three convolutional neural networks are evaluated for the following wireless signal representations: temporal IQ data, the amplitude/phase representation and the frequency domain representation. From our analysis we prove that the wireless data representation impacts the accuracy depending on the specifics and similarities of the wireless signals that need to be differentiated, with different data representations resulting in accuracy variations of up to 29%. Experimental results show that using the amplitude/phase representation for recognizing modulation formats can lead to performance improvements up to 2% and 12% for medium to high SNR compared to IQ and frequency domain data, respectively. For the task of detecting interference, frequency domain representation outperformed amplitude/phase and IQ data representation up to 20%.},

abstract={High peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) has been one of the major drawbacks of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. In this letter, we propose a novel PAPR reduction scheme, known as PAPR reducing network (PRNet), based on the autoencoder architecture of deep learning. In the PRNet, the constellation mapping and demapping of symbols on each subcarrier is determined adaptively through a deep learning technique, such that both the bit error rate (BER) and the PAPR of the OFDM system are jointly minimized.

abstract={In frequency division duplex mode, the downlink channel state information (CSI) should be sent to the base station through feedback links so that the potential gains of a massive multiple-input multiple-output can be exhibited. However, such a transmission is hindered by excessive feedback overhead. In this letter, we use deep learning technology to develop CsiNet, a novel CSI sensing and recovery mechanism that learns to effectively use channel structure from training samples. CsiNet learns a transformation from CSI to a near-optimal number of representations (or codewords) and an inverse transformation from codewords to CSI. We perform experiments to demonstrate that CsiNet can recover CSI with significantly improved reconstruction quality compared with existing compressive sensing (CS)-based methods. Even at excessively low compression regions where CS-based methods cannot work, CsiNet retains effective beamforming gain.},

abstract={This letter proposes a deep learning-based pilot assignment scheme (DL-PAS) for a massive multiple-input multipleoutput (massive MIMO) system that utilizes a large number of antennas for multiple users. The proposed DL-PAS improves the performance in cellular networks with severe pilot contamination by learning the relationship between pilot assignment and the users’ location pattern. In this work, we design a novel supervised learning method where input features and output labels are users’ locations in all cells and pilot assignments, respectively. Specifically, pretrained optimal pilot assignments with given users’ locations are provided through an exhaustive search method as the training data. Then, the proposed DL-PAS provides a nearoptimal pilot assignment from the produced inferred function by analyzing the training data. We implement the proposed scheme using a commercial deep multilayer perceptron system. Simulation-based experiments show that the proposed scheme achieves almost 99.38% theoretical upper-bound performance with low complexity, requiring only 0.92 ms computational time.},

title={Joint Adaptation of Frequency Hopping and Transmission Rate for Anti-Jamming Wireless Systems}, 
year={2016}, 
volume={15}, 
number={9}, 
pages={2247-2259}, 
abstract={Wireless transmissions are inherently vulnerable to jamming attacks. Frequency hopping (FH) and transmission rate adaptation (RA) have been separately used to mitigate jamming. When RA is used alone, it has been shown that a jammer who randomizes its power levels can force the transmitter to always operate at the lowest rate, by maintaining the average jamming power above a certain threshold. On the other hand, when only FH is used, a high throughput overhead is incurred due to frequent channel switching. In this paper, we propose to mitigate jamming by jointly optimizing the FH and RA techniques. This way, the transmitter can escape the jammer by changing its channel, adjusting its rate, or both. We consider a power-constrained “reactive-sweep” jammer who aims at degrading the throughput of the wireless link. The jammer sweeps through the set of channels, jamming a subset of them at a time, using the optimal jamming power. We model the interactions between the legitimate transmitter and jammer as a constrained zero-sum Markov game. The transmitter's optimal defense strategy is derived by obtaining the equilibria of the constrained Markov game. This policy informs the transmitter when to hop to another channel and when to stay on the current channel. Furthermore, it gives the best transmission rate to use in both cases (hop or stay). The structure of the transmitter's optimal policy is shown to be threshold type, whereby the transmitter stays on the same channel up to a certain number of time slots after which it hops. We analyze the “constrained Nash equilibrium” of the Markov game and show that the equilibrium defense strategy of the transmitter is deterministic. Numerical investigations show that the new scheme improves the average throughput and provides better jamming resiliency.},

abstract={The complexity and sophistication of communications jamming will continue to increase over time. The traditional approach to jammer mitigation is to harden radios, often sacrificing communications performance for more advanced jamming protection. To provide an escape from this trend, we propose a jammer exploitation strategy in which the communications system causes an enemy reactive jammer to act as an unwitting relay. This can lead to an improvement in communications as a result of the jamming attack itself. The strategy proposed in this letter revolves around using a frequency-shift keying waveform that is tuned in such a way to exploit the jammer's behavior. We derive the channel capacity when using the waveform along with practical coding, and provide numerical results to gain insight.},

pages={394-408}, 
abstract={A reactive jammer jams wireless channels only when target devices are transmitting; Compared to constant jamming, reactive jamming is harder to track and compensate against [2], [38]. Frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) and direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) have been widely used as countermeasures against jamming attacks. However, both will fail if the jammer jams all frequency channels or has high transmit power. In this paper, we propose an anti-jamming communication system that allows communication in the presence of a broadband and high power reactive jammer. The proposed system transmits messages by harnessing the reaction time of a reactive jammer. It does not assume a reactive jammer with limited spectrum coverage and transmit power, and thus can be used in scenarios where traditional approaches fail. We develop a prototype of the proposed system using GNURadio. Our experimental evaluation shows that when a powerful reactive jammer is present, the prototype still keeps communication, whereas other schemes such as 802.11 DSSS fail completely.},

title={SecureMAC: Securing Wireless Medium Access Control Against Insider Denial-of-Service Attacks}, 
year={2017}, 
volume={16}, 
number={12}, 
pages={3527-3540}, 
abstract={Wireless network dynamically allocates channel resources to improve spectral efficiency and, to avoid collisions, has its users cooperate with each other using a medium access control (MAC) protocol. However, MAC assumes user compliance and can be detrimental when a user misbehaves. An attacker who compromised the network can launch more devastating denial-of-service (DoS) attacks than a network outsider by sending excessive reservation requests to waste bandwidth, by listening to the control messages and conducting power-efficient jamming, by falsifying information to manipulate the network control, and so on. We build SecureMAC to defend against such insider threats while retaining the benefits of coordination between the cooperative users. SecureMAC is comprised of four components: channelization to prevent excessive reservations, randomization to thwart reactive targeted jamming, coordination to counter control-message aware jamming and resolve over-reserved and under-reserved spectrum, and power attribution to determine each node's contribution to the received power. Our theoretical analyses and implementation evaluations demonstrate superior performance over previous approaches, which either ignore security issues or give up the benefit of cooperation when under attack by disabling user coordination (such as the Nash equilibrium of continuous wideband transmission). In realistic scenarios, our SecureMAC implementation outperforms such schemes by 76-159 percent.},

abstract={The timing channel is a logical communication channel in which information is encoded in the timing between events. Recently, the use of the timing channel has been proposed as a countermeasure to reactive jamming attacks performed by an energy-constrained malicious node. In fact, while a jammer is able to disrupt the information contained in the attacked packets, timing information cannot be jammed, and therefore, timing channels can be exploited to deliver information to the receiver even on a jammed channel. Since the nodes under attack and the jammer have conflicting interests, their interactions can be modeled by means of game theory. Accordingly, in this paper, a game-theoretic model of the interactions between nodes exploiting the timing channel to achieve resilience to jamming attacks and a jammer is derived and analyzed. More specifically, the Nash equilibrium is studied in terms of existence, uniqueness, and convergence under best response dynamics. Furthermore, the case in which the communication nodes set their strategy and the jammer reacts accordingly is modeled and analyzed as a Stackelberg game, by considering both perfect and imperfect knowledge of the jammer's utility function. Extensive numerical results are presented, showing the impact of network parameters on the system performance.},

abstract={Due to the broadcast nature of radio propagation, the wireless air interface is open and accessible to both authorized and illegitimate users. This completely differs from a wired network, where communicating devices are physically connected through cables and a node without direct association is unable to access the network for illicit activities. The open communications environment makes wireless transmissions more vulnerable than wired communications to malicious attacks, including both the passive eavesdropping for data interception and the active jamming for disrupting legitimate transmissions. Therefore, this paper is motivated to examine the security vulnerabilities and threats imposed by the inherent open nature of wireless communications and to devise efficient defense mechanisms for improving the wireless network security. We first summarize the security requirements of wireless networks, including their authenticity, confidentiality, integrity, and availability issues. Next, a comprehensive overview of security attacks encountered in wireless networks is presented in view of the network protocol architecture, where the potential security threats are discussed at each protocol layer. We also provide a survey of the existing security protocols and algorithms that are adopted in the existing wireless network standards, such as the Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, WiMAX, and the long-term evolution (LTE) systems. Then, we discuss the state of the art in physical-layer security, which is an emerging technique of securing the open communications environment against eavesdropping attacks at the physical layer. Several physical-layer security techniques are reviewed and compared, including information-theoretic security, artificial-noise-aided security, security-oriented beamforming, diversity-assisted security, and physical-layer key generation approaches. Since a jammer emitting radio signals can readily interfere with the legitimate wireless users, we also introduce the fam- ly of various jamming attacks and their countermeasures, including the constant jammer, intermittent jammer, reactive jammer, adaptive jammer, and intelligent jammer. Additionally, we discuss the integration of physical-layer security into existing authentication and cryptography mechanisms for further securing wireless networks. Finally, some technical challenges which remain unresolved at the time of writing are summarized and the future trends in wireless security are discussed.},

pages={1264-1278}, 
abstract={Frequency offset (FO) refers to the difference in the operating frequencies of two radio oscillators. Failure to compensate for the FO may lead to decoding errors, particularly in OFDM systems. To correct the FO, wireless standards append a publicly known preamble to every frame before transmission. In this paper, we demonstrate how an adversary can exploit the known preamble structure of OFDM-based wireless systems, particularly IEEE802.11a/g/n/ac, to launch a very stealth (low energy/duty cycle) reactive jamming attack against the FO estimation mechanism. In this attack, the adversary quickly detects a transmitted OFDM frame and subsequently jams a tiny part of the preamble that is used for FO estimation at the legitimate receiver. By optimizing the energy and structure of the jamming signal and accounting for frame detection timing errors and unknown channel parameters, we empirically show that the adversary can induce a bit error rate close to $0.5$ , making the transmission practically irrecoverable. Such vulnerability to FO jamming exists even when the frame is shielded by efficient channel coding. We evaluate the FO estimation attack through simulations and USRP experimentation. We also propose three approaches to mitigate such an attack.},

Antifragility refers to systems that increase in capability, resilience, or robustness as a result of mistakes, faults, attacks, or failures. An antifragile system is fundamentally different from one that is resilient (able to recover from failure) and robust (able to resist failure). We apply the concept of antifragility to wireless communications where the system stressor is a jammer that intends to disrupt the underlying communications. Through a novel strategy, we exploit the communications jammer, providing an increase in communications capability such as bits per second. We show that an antifragile gain is possible under a wide variety of reactive jamming scenarios and provide guidelines for realizing these gains by creating an antifragile waveform.},

pages={1486-1499}, 
abstract={Jamming attack is a serious threat to the wireless communications. Reactive jamming maximizes the attack efficiency by jamming only when the targets are communicating, which can be readily implemented using software-defined radios. In this paper, we explore the use of the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) technology to achieve jamming resilient orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) communication. In particular, MIMO interference cancellation treats jamming signals as noise and strategically cancels them out, while transmit precoding adjusts the signal directions to optimize the decoding performance. We first investigate the reactive jamming strategies and their impacts on the MIMO-OFDM receivers. We then present a MIMO-based anti-jamming scheme that exploits MIMO interference cancellation and transmit precoding technologies to turn a jammed non-connectivity scenario into an operational network.

abstract={Malicious interference injection or jamming is one of the simplest ways to disrupt wireless communications. Prior approaches can alleviate jamming interference to a limited extent; they are especially vulnerable to a reactive jammer i.e., a jammer that injects noise upon sensing a legitimate transmission or wideband jamming. In this paper, we leverage the inherent features of OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) to cope with such attacks. Specifically, via extensive experiments, we observe that the jamming signal experiences differing levels of fading across the composite sub-carriers in its transmission bandwidth. Thus, if the legitimate transmitter were to somehow exploit the relatively unaffected sub-carriers to transmit data to the receiver, it could achieve reasonable throughputs, even in the presence of the active jammer. We design and implement JIMS, a Jamming Interference Mitigation Scheme that exploits the above characteristic by overcoming key practical challenges. Via extensive testbed experiments and simulations we show that JIMS achieves a throughput restoration of up to 75 percent in the presence of an active jammer.},

abstract={We address the problem of improving the throughput and security of multi-channel MAC (MMAC) protocols. We design a protocol called FD-MMAC that exploits recent advances in full duplex (FD) communications to coordinate channel access in a distributed manner. Compared with prior MMAC designs, our protocol eliminates the use of dedicated in-band or out-of-band control channels for resolving contention, discovering the resident channel of destinations, and performing load balancing. The elimination of the control channel improves spectral efficiency and mitigates denial-of-service attacks that specifically target the exchange of control information. Moreover, FD-MMAC enables the operation of multi-channel exposed terminals. To achieve these goals, we integrate an advanced suite of PHY-layer techniques, including self interference suppression, error vector magnitude and received power measurements, and signal correlation. We validate the proposed PHY-layer techniques on the NI USRP testbed. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the throughput performance of FD-MMAC and verify our analysis via packet level simulations. Our results show that FD-MMAC achieves significantly higherthroughput compared with prior art. Finally, we analyze the resilience of FD-MMAC to reactive jamming attacks.},

This letter proposes a new adaptive blind source separation algorithm, which is referred to as vector auto-regressive diagonalization (VAR-JD), to deal with this problem. This algorithm estimates demixing matrix by matrix joint JD of a set of matrices containing the estimated VAR coefficients. Compared with traditional adaptive BSS method, which assumes that source signals are mutual independent and no more than one Gaussian source signal exists, the proposed VAR-JD algorithm is not only able to separate independent source signals but also dependent source signals, and there is no demand for the number of Gaussian source signals. Simulation results on the separation of synthetic and communication signals demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This latter is important to anti-jamming communications. Moreover, VAR-JD is suitable for determined mixtures and can extend easily to overdetermined mixtures.},

abstract={In the Internet of Things (IoT), the malicious node with sensorial capability can smartly launch jamming attacks only when it detects the legitimate transmission, known as the reactive jamming. Compared with the conventional constant jamming model, the reactive nature enables highly efficient and long-lasting attacks with limited energy supply, which thus presents a significant threat upon the secure communications in IoT. In this paper, we investigate the anti-reactive-jamming transmission strategy for IoT by exploiting the inherent weakness of the jammer. Specifically, since the reactive jamming depends on the detection of the legitimate transmission, the legitimate user can elaborately determine its transmit power to tradeoff between its achieved signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the probability to be detected and jammed by its adversary. Meanwhile, the jammer can smartly allocate the jamming power based on its observation of the legitimate transmission. We formulate the rivalry between the legitimate user and jammer as a hierarchical game, where the legitimate user takes action first as the leader while the jammer is the follower. We analyze the game equilibrium for both single-channel and multi-channel scenarios and derive the optimal transmission and jamming strategies for the legitimate user and jammer, respectively. Finally, we present the numerical results to evaluate the performance of the secure IoT communications under our proposal.},

Specifically, we characterize the transmission success rate of a car-to-car link subject to constant, periodic, and reactive RF jamming. First, we conduct extensive measurements in an anechoic chamber, where we study the benefits of built-in techniques for interference mitigation. In addition, we identify that the periodic transmission of preamble-like jamming signals can hinder successful communication despite being up to five orders of magnitude weaker than the signal of interest. We further provide the rationale behind this remarkably high jamming effectiveness. Additionally, we quantify the impact of reaction delay and interference signal length on the effectiveness of the reactive jammer. Then, by means of outdoor measurements, we evaluate the suitability of using the indoor measurements as a model to characterize the performance of car-to-car communications in the presence of RF jamming. Finally, we conduct outdoor measurements emulating a vehicular platoon and study the threats that RF jamming poses to this vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) application. We observe that constant, periodic, but also reactive jamming can hinder communication over large propagation areas, which would threaten road safety.},

abstract={Frequency jamming is known as an efficient attack tool to disrupt wireless communication. This efficiency can also be exploited for the benefit of a network-an idea often referred to as friendly jamming. A prominent application case is the blocking of unauthenticated or malicious communication, such as injection attacks. In this paper, we propose access points as a natural place to implement friendly jamming functionality. We analyze this proposal using simulations, introduce an implementation on customer-grade access points, and report measurement results from the first real-world study of friendly jamming in an IEEE 802.11 campus network. We discover a fundamental tradeoff between the effectiveness of friendly jamming and the orthogonal aspect of having minimal side-effects to the campus network's traffic. In particular, we observed what we call the power amplification phenomenon. This effect aggravates the known hidden station problem when the number of jammers increases. We also find evidence that the collaboration between jammers can enable friendly jamming, which is both effective and minimally invasive.},

abstract={Resource allocation is an important topic with a wide range of applications. In many practical cases, users and resource suppliers are players in the market. As a result, much effort has been made in applying market mechanisms (such as auction and game-theoretic results) to resource allocation. The conventional approach in such studies is to consider cases where users' resource demands are fixed. However, in practice, resource demands are often elastic, which can be related to the quality of experience (QoE) that the user receives. We consider elastic resource demands in this paper, and propose a double auction and negotiation (DAN) scheme, which includes a conventional auction stage as well as a negotiation stage, where the latter allows users to dynamically adjust their demands. The proposed DAN scheme not only allows more users to get access to some amount of resource (thereby avoiding users becoming completely disconnected), but also increases the payoff of resource suppliers, as is confirmed by simulations. We also discuss the conditions of having Nash equilibrium in the users' resource demands and suppliers' pricing in the negotiation stage.},

abstract={In recent years, robotic systems combined with cloud computing capability have become an emerging topic of discussion in academic fields. The concept of cloud robotics allows the system to offload computing-intensive tasks from the robots to the cloud. An appropriate resource allocation scheme is necessary for the cloud computing service platform to efficiently allocate its computing resources when the robots send requests asking for computing service. This paper proposes a resource allocation scheme based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), which can make the cloud to decide whether a request should be accepted and how many resources are supposed to be allocated. The scheme realizes an autonomous management of computing resources through online learning, reduces human participation in scheme planning, and improves the overall utility of the system in the long run. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based computing resource allocation scheme has better performances than the Greedy Allocation (GA) scheme.},

abstract={Dynamic channel allocation (DCA) is the key technology to efficiently utilize the spectrum resources and decrease the co-channel interference for multibeam satellite systems. Most works allocate the channel on the basis of the beam traffic load or the user terminal distribution of the current moment. These greedy-like algorithms neglect the intrinsic temporal correlation among the sequential channel allocation decisions, resulting in the spectrum resources underutilization. To solve this problem, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based dynamic channel allocation (DRL-DCA) algorithm is proposed. Specifically, the DCA optimization problem, which aims at minimizing the service blocking probability, is formulated in multibeam satellite systems. Due to the temporal correlation property, the DCA optimization problem is modeled as the Markov decision process (MDP) which is the dominant analytical approach in DRL. In modeled MDP, the system state is reformulated into an image-like fashion, and then convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract useful features. Simulation results show that the DRL-DCA algorithm can decrease the blocking probability and improve the carried traffic and spectrum efficiency compared with other channel allocation algorithms.},

abstract={Robotic soccer games, which have become popular, require timely and precise decision-making in a dynamic environment. To address the problems of complexity in a critical situation, policy improvement in robotic soccer games must occur. This paper proposes an adaptive decision-making method that uses reinforcement learning (RL), and the decision-making system for a robotic soccer game is composed of two subsystems. The first subsystem in the architecture for the proposed method criticizes the situation, and the second subsystem implements decision-making policy. Inspired by the support vector machine (SVM), a situation classification method, which is called an improved SVM, embeds a decision tree structure and simultaneously addresses the problems of a large scale and multiple classifications. When a variety of situations that are collected in the field are classified and congregated into the tree structure, the problem of local strategy selection for each individual class of situations over time is regarded as a RL problem and is solved using a Q-learning method. The results of simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method allows satisfactory decision-making.},

abstract={The ongoing increasing traffic in the era of big data yields unprecedented demands in user experience and network capacity expansion. The users of next generation mobile networks (5G) should be able to use 3GPP, IEEE, and other technologies simultaneously. The integration of multiple Radio Access Technologies (RATs) of licensed or unlicensed bands has been widely deemed as a cost-efficient way to greatly increase network capacity. In this paper, we propose a Smart Aggregated RAT Access (SARA) strategy with aim of maximizing the long-term network throughput while meeting diverse traffic Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. We consider the scenario that users with different QoS requirements access to a Heterogeneous Network (HetNet) with coexisting Cellular-WiFi. In order to maximize system throughput while meeting diverse traffic QoS requirements in such a complex and dynamic environment, we exploit multi-agent reinforcement learning to perform RAT selection in conjunction with resource allocation for individual user access requests, through sensing dynamic channel states and traffic QoS requirements. In SARA, we first use Nash Q-learning to provide a set of feasible RAT selection strategies while decreasing the strategy space in learning process, and then employ Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based Q-learning to perform resource allocation. Numerical results reveal that the network throughput can be maximized while meeting various traffic QoS requirements with limited number of searches by using our proposed SARA algorithm. For bulk arrival access requests, a suboptimal solution can be obtained as high computational complexity is incurred for achieving global optimality. Another attractive feature of SARA is that a tradeoff between the solution optimality and learning time can be readily made by terminating the search of MCTS according to the time constraint. Compared with traditional WiFi offloading schemes, SARA can significantly improve network throughput whil- guaranteeing traffic QoS requirements.},

pages={1-1}, 
abstract={Frequency hopping-based anti-jamming techniques are not always applicable in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) due to the high mobility of onboard units (OBUs) and the large-scale network topology. In this paper, we use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to relay the message of an OBU and improve the communication performance of VANETs against smart jammers that observe the ongoing OBU and UAV communication status and even induce the UAV to use a specific relay strategy and then attack it accordingly. More specifically, the UAV relays the OBU message to another roadside unit (RSU) with a better radio transmission condition if the serving RSU is heavily jammed or interfered. The interactions between a UAV and a smart jammer are formulated as an anti-jamming UAV relay game, in which the UAV decides whether or not to relay the OBU message to another RSU, and the jammer observes the UAV and VANET strategy and chooses the jamming power accordingly. The Nash equilibria of the UAV relay game are derived to reveal how the optimal UAV relay strategy depends on the transmit cost and the UAV channel model. A hotbooting policy hill climbing (PHC)-based UAV relay strategy is proposed to help VANET resist jamming in the dynamic game without being aware of the VANET model and the jamming model. Simulation results show that the proposed relay strategy can efficiently reduce the bit error rate of the OBU message and thus increase the utility of the VANET compared with a Q-learning based scheme.},

abstract={This paper studies adaptive transmission in an underwater acoustic (UWA) point-to-point communication system that operates on an epoch-by-epoch basis for a long term. A fixed amount of information bits periodically arrive at the transmitter data queue, and wait for transmission via a number of packets within each epoch. To trade off energy consumption with transmission latency, the transmitter decides the transmission action at the beginning of each epoch, including to transmit or not, and the transmission power and the modulation-and-coding parameters, based on the data queue status and the predicted channel conditions in the current and future epochs. To describe both the fast fading and the large-scale shadowing of UWA channels, the channel within each epoch is characterized by a compound Nakagamilognormal distribution, and the evolution of the distribution parameters is modeled as an unknown Markov process. Given that the channel can only be observed during active transmissions, we formulate the adaptive transmission problem as a partially observable Markov decision process, and develop an online algorithm in a model-based reinforcement learning framework. The algorithm recursively estimates the channel model parameters, tracks the channel dynamics, and computes the optimal transmission action that minimizes a long-term system cost. Emulated results based on channel measurements from two-field experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves decent performance relative to a benchmark method that assumes perfect and non-causal channel knowledge.},

abstract={Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems are vulnerable to jamming attacks, especially smart jammers who apply programmable and smart radio devices such as software defined radios to flexibly control their jamming strategy according to the ongoing NOMA transmission and radio environment. In this paper, the power allocation of a base station in a NOMA system equipped with multiple antennas contending with a smart jammer is formulated as a zero-sum game, in which the base station as the leader first chooses the transmit power on multiple antennas while a jammer as the follower selects the jamming power to interrupt the transmission of the users. A Stackelberg equilibrium of the anti-jamming NOMA transmission game is derived and the conditions assuring its existence are provided to disclose the impact of multiple antennas and radio channel states. A reinforcement learning based power control scheme is proposed for the downlink NOMA transmission without being aware of the jamming and radio channel parameters. The Dyna architecture that formulates a learned world model from the real anti-jamming transmission experience and the hotbooting technique that exploits experiences in similar scenarios to initialize the quality values are used to accelerate the learning speed of the Q-learning based power allocation and thus improve the communication efficiency of NOMA transmission in the presence of smart jammers. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can significantly increase the sum data rates of users and thus the utilities compared with the standard Q-learning based strategy.},

abstract={Reinforcement learning (RL) has distinguished itself as a prominent learning method to augment the efficacy of autonomous systems. Recent advances in deep learning studies have complemented existing RL methods and led to a crucial breakthrough in the effort of applying RL to automation and robotics. Artificial agents based on deep RL can take selective and intelligent actions comparable with those of a human to maximize the feedback reward from the interactive environment. In this paper, we survey recent developments in the literature regarding deep RL methods for building human-level agents.

abstract={The model of a stochastic production/inventory system that is subject to deterioration failures is developed and examined in this paper. Customer interarrival times are assumed to be random and backorders are allowed. The system experiences a number of deterioration stages before it ultimately fails and is rendered inoperable. Repair and maintenance activities restore the system to its initial and previous deterioration state, respectively. The duration of both repair and maintenance is assumed to be stochastic. We address the problem of minimizing the expected sum of two conflicting objective functions: the average inventory level and the average number of backorders. The solution to this problem consists of finding the optimal tradeoff between maintaining a high service level and carrying as low inventory as possible. The primary goal of this research is to obtain optimal or near-optimal joint production/maintenance control policies, by means of a novel reinforcement learning-based approach. Furthermore, we examine parametric production and maintenance policies that are often used in practical situations, namely, Kanban, (s, S), threshold-type condition based maintenance and periodic maintenance. The proposed approach is compared with the parametric policies in an extensive series of simulation experiments and it is found to clearly outperform them in all cases. Based on the numerical results obtained by the experiments, the behavior of the parametric policies as well as the structure of the control policies derived by the Reinforcement Learning-based approach is investigated.},

pages={680-692}, 
abstract={Densely deployment of various small-cell base stations in cellular networks to increase capacity will lead to heterogeneous networks (HetNets), and meanwhile, embedding the energy harvesting capabilities in base stations as an alternative energy supply is becoming a reality. How to make efficient utilization of radio resource and renewable energy is a brand-new challenge. This paper investigates the optimal policy for user scheduling and resource allocation in HetNets powered by hybrid energy with the purpose of maximizing energy efficiency of the overall network. Since wireless channel conditions and renewable energy arrival rates have stochastic properties and the environment's dynamics are unknown, the model-free reinforcement learning approach is used to learn the optimal policy through interactions with the environment. To solve our problem with continuous-valued state and action variables, a policy-gradient-based actor-critic algorithm is proposed. The actor part uses the Gaussian distribution as the parameterized policy to generate continuous stochastic actions, and the policy parameters are updated with the gradient ascent method. The critic part uses compatible function approximation to estimate the performance of the policy and helps the actor learn the gradient of the policy. The advantage function is used to further reduce the variance of the policy gradient. Using the numerical simulations, we demonstrate the convergence property of the proposed algorithm and analyze network energy efficiency.},

year={2018}, 
volume={6}, 
number={}, 
pages={5716-5726}, 
abstract={This paper proposed a reinforcement learning method to improve the level-of-service (LOS) for a shared-taxi system. In practice, shared-taxi operators usually insert a new arrival request into a vehicle routing system that can minimize current total waiting time and detour distance. However, the LOS of a shared-taxi system does not involve only the total waiting time and detour distance but also the quantity of serviced trip volume. If operators emphasize only on the reduction of the total waiting time and detour distance for current requests, the transport capacity of a shared-taxi system can be excessively expended and cannot reflect future requests effectively. This could lead to a high rejection rate for future requests and damage the global LOS. The proposed reinforcement learning method takes into account the uncertainty of future requests and can make a look-ahead decision to help the operator improve the global LOS of a shared-taxi system. We also tested the proposed method on large-scale networks to verify the performance of the method.},

abstract={In the last years, Internet is evolving towards the cloud-computing paradigm complemented by fog-computing in order to distribute computing, storage, control, networking resources, and services close to end-user devices as much as possible, while sending heavy jobs to the remote cloud. When fog-computing nodes cannot be powered by the main electric grid, some environmental-friendly solutions, such as the use of solaror wind-based generators could be adopted. Their relatively unpredictable power output makes it necessary to include an energy storage system in order to provide power, when a peak of work occurs during periods of low-power generation. An optimized management of such an energy storage system in a green fog-computing node is necessary in order to improve the system performance, allowing the system to cope with high job arrival peaks even during low-power generation periods. In this perspective, this paper adopts reinforcement learning to choose a server activation policy that ensures the minimum job loss probability. A case study is presented to show how the proposed system works, and an extensive performance analysis of a fog-computing node highlights the importance of optimizing battery management according to the size of the Renewable-Energy Generator system and the number of available servers.},

abstract={Both caching and interference alignment (IA) are promising techniques for next-generation wireless networks. Nevertheless, most of the existing works on cache-enabled IA wireless networks assume that the channel is invariant, which is unrealistic considering the time-varying nature of practical wireless environments. In this paper, we consider realistic time-varying channels. Specifically, the channel is formulated as a finite-state Markov channel (FSMC). The complexity of the system is very high when we consider realistic FSMC models. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning approach, which is an advanced reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a deep Q network to approximate the Q value-action function. We use Google TensorFlow to implement deep reinforcement learning in this paper to obtain the optimal IA user selection policy in cache-enabled opportunistic IA wireless networks.

pages={11330-11338}, 
abstract={Machine type communication (MTC), as one of the most promising technologies in the future wireless communication, has brought mobile communication network into a new level. The breakthrough of cutting-edge technology and broad coverage of cellular networks in long term evolution advanced network constitute an ideal platform for ubiquitous MTC service provisioning on a large scale. However, under the traditional attach approach, the massive MTC devices always select the evolved NodeB (eNB) with the best signal quality for the attachment, thereby causing the network congestion and overload. As a result, it is necessary to design an efficient eNB selection scheme to avoid overload issue. In this paper, by modeling MTC arrivals using nonhomogeneous poisson process with the memoryless property, we formulate the eNB selection problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and try to compute an optimal solution. Since the network parameters for MDP are not obtained easily, a learning-based algorithm with value-difference based exploration (VDBE) policy who could leverage both present conditions and expected future demands is further proposed. The performances of the proposed reinforcement learning (RL) VDBE, other RL-based, the legacy best-signal-quality, and MDP without RL eNB-selection schemes are analyzed in terms of blocking probability, transmission rate, and load balancing. The simulation results show that our scheme has the best performance on the blocking probability and loading balancing while an acceptable result on the transmission rate. It is suitable for the MTC environment with a highly changed number of MTC arrivals while without high requirement on the transmission rate.},

abstract={Communication-based train control (CBTC) systems are automated train control systems based on continuous and bidirectional train-ground communications. CBTC is the direction of future train control systems. Complex channel condition and frequent handoff can severely affect urban rail CBTC train-ground communication performance, and consequently affect CBTC operation efficiency. Current research regarding CBTC does not consider the impact of train-ground communications on train control performance. This paper studies the joint optimization of communication and control in CBTC systems. With the objective to minimize the optimal operation profile tracking error and energy consumption, linear quadratic cost is defined as the control performance measure. In order to ensure train operation safety, the optimization model puts constraints on train control actions related to safety. Moreover, based on the stochastic channel characteristics and the real-time train position information, handoff decision and train control policy are jointly optimized using deep reinforcement learning. Extensive simulation results based on real-field channel measurements illustrate that the proposed optimization method can significantly improve the train control performance in CBTC systems, and CBTC systems need to sacrifice part of performance to ensure system safety.},

abstract={Future wireless networks (e.g., 5G) will consist of multiple radio access technologies (RATs). In these networks, deciding which RAT users should connect to is not a trivial problem. Current fully distributed algorithms although guaranteeing convergence to equilibrium states, are often slow, require high exploration times and may converge to undesirable equilibria. To overcome these limitations, this paper develops a network feedback framework that uses limited network-assisted information to improve efficiency of distributed algorithms for RAT selection problem. We prove theoretically that a fully distributed algorithm developed within this framework is guaranteed to converge to a set of correlated equilibria. Our framework guarantees convergence in self-play even when only a single user applies the algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that our solution: 1) is highly efficient with fast convergence time and low signaling overheads while achieving competitive, if not better, performance both in fairness and utility, as well as achieving lower per-user switchings than state-of-the-art algorithms; and 2) can flexibly support a wide range of network-assisted feedback. The simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution in a heterogeneous environment, where users may potentially apply a number of different RAT selection procedures.},

abstract={This paper investigates the problem of distributed resource sharing in a device-to-device enabled heterogeneous network, where the various device pairs choose their transmission channels, modes, base stations (BSs), and power levels without any control by the BSs based only on the locally-observable information. This problem is represented as a Bayesian coalition formation game, where the players (device pairs) create coalitions to maximize their long-term rewards with no prior knowledge of the values of potential coalitions and the types of their members. To minimize these uncertainties, a novel Bayesian reinforcement learning (RL) model is derived. In this model, the players update (through repeated coalition formation) their beliefs about the types and coalitional values to reach a stable coalitional agreement. The proposed Bayesian RL-based coalition formation algorithms are implemented in a long-term evolution advanced network and evaluated using simulations. The algorithms show a superior performance when compared with other relevant resource allocation schemes and achieve near-optimal results after a relatively small number of RL iterations.},

abstract={With the acceleration of urbanization in the world, urban traffic congestion has become an urgent challenge in most cities. Adaptive traffic signal control is the most approved control method to solve the problem, and accurate real-time traffic information is critical to this solution. This paper presents distributed cooperative reinforcement learning-based traffic control that integrates V2X networks' dynamic clustering algorithm. To obtain traffic flow information accurately and instantaneously, it is important to improve the cluster stability in V2X networks. A dynamic clustering algorithm is proposed based on the enhanced affinity propagation. The proposed clustering algorithm introduces the initial cluster partition to maintain a proper cluster size and adds the lane and destination factors to improve the cluster's stability. The algorithm can provide efficient and accurate traffic state information to traffic signal controls. By integrating the clustering algorithm, a cooperative reinforcement learning control scheme is proposed to balance the traffic load. To address the tough dimensionality curse of reinforcement learning, a distributed mechanism for intersection cooperation is introduced, and a fast gradient-descent function approximation method is proposed to improve the controls' real-time performance. The proposed intelligent traffic control scheme that integrates the stable clustering algorithm can effectively improve the traffic throughput, reduce the average waiting time, and avoid congestion. Numerical simulations on real scenarios validate the performance of the proposed approach.},

abstract={Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have been attracting interest for their potential roles in intelligent transport systems (ITS). In order to enable distributed ITS, there is a need to maintain some information in the vehicular networks without the support of any infrastructure such as road side units. In this paper, we propose a protocol that can store the data in VANETs by transferring data to a new carrier (vehicle) before the current data carrier is moving out of a specified region. For the next data carrier node selection, the protocol employs fuzzy logic to evaluate instant reward by taking into account multiple metrics, specifically throughput, vehicle velocity, and bandwidth efficiency. In addition, a reinforcement learning-based algorithm is used to consider the future reward of a decision. For the data collection, the protocol uses a cluster-based forwarding approach to improve the efficiency of wireless resource utilization. We use theoretical analysis and computer simulations to evaluate the proposed protocol.},

abstract={In a vehicular network where roadside units (RSUs) are deprived from a permanent grid-power connection, vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications are disrupted once the RSU's battery is completely drained. These batteries are recharged regularly either by human intervention or using energy harvesting techniques, such as solar or wind energy. As such, it becomes particularly crucial to conserve battery power until the next recharge cycle in order to maintain network operation and connectivity. This paper examines a vehicular network whose RSU dispossesses a permanent power source but is instead equipped with a large battery, which is periodically recharged. In what follows, a reinforcement learning technique, i.e., protocol for energy-efficient adaptive scheduling using reinforcement learning (PEARL), is proposed for the purpose of optimizing the RSU's downlink traffic scheduling during a discharge period. PEARL's objective is to equip the RSU with the required artificial intelligence to realize and, hence, exploit an optimal scheduling policy that will guarantee the operation of the vehicular network during the discharge cycle while fulfilling the largest number of service requests. The simulation input parameters were chosen in a way that guarantees the convergence of PEARL, whose exploitation showed better results when compared with three heuristic benchmark scheduling algorithms in terms of a vehicle's quality of experience and the RSU's throughput. For instance, the deployment of the well-trained PEARL agent resulted in at least 50% improved performance over the best heuristic algorithm in terms of the percentage of vehicles departing with incomplete service requests.},

abstract={Cognitive radio (CR) enables unlicensed users to explore and exploit underutilized licensed channels (or white spaces). While multi-hop CR network has drawn significant research interest in recent years, majority work has been validated through simulation. A key challenge in multi-hop CR network is to select a route with high quality of service (QoS) and lesser number of route breakages. In this paper, we propose three route selection schemes to enhance the network performance of CR networks, and investigate them using a real testbed environment, which consists of universal software radio peripheral and GNU radio units. Two schemes are based on reinforcement learning (RL), while a scheme is based on spectrum leasing (SL). RL is an artificial intelligence technique, whereas SL is a new paradigm that allows communication between licensed and unlicensed users in CR networks. We compare the route selection schemes with an existing route selection scheme in the literature, called highest-channel (HC), in a multi-hop CR network. With respect to the QoS parameters (i.e., throughput, packet delivery ratio, and the number of route breakages), the experimental results show that RL approaches achieve a better performance in comparison with the HC approach, and also achieve close to the performance achieved by the SL approach.},

pages={3674-3684}, 
abstract={This paper proposes a novel demand response method that aims at reducing the long-term cost of charging the battery of an individual plug-in electric vehicle (PEV). The problem is cast as a daily decision-making problem for choosing the amount of energy to be charged in the PEV battery within a day. We model the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with unknown transition probabilities. A batch reinforcement-learning (RL) algorithm is proposed for learning an optimum cost-reducing charging policy from a batch of transition samples and making cost-reducing charging decisions in new situations. In order to capture the day-to-day differences of electricity charging costs, the method makes use of actual electricity prices for the current day and predicted electricity prices for the following day. A Bayesian neural network is employed for predicting the electricity prices. For constructing the RL training dataset, we use historical prices. A linear-programming-based method is developed for creating a dataset of optimal charging decisions. Different charging scenarios are simulated for each day of the historical time frame using the set of past electricity prices. Simulation results using real-world pricing data demonstrate cost savings of 10%-50% for the PEV owner when using the proposed charging method.},

abstract={An important problem of today's mobile network operators is to bring down the capital expenditures and operational expenditures. One strategy is to automate the parameter tuning on the small cells through the so-called self-organizing network (SON) functionalities, such as cell range expansion, mobility robustness optimization, or enhanced Inter-Cell Interference Coordination. Having several of these functionalities in the network will surely create conflicts, as, for example, they may try to change the same parameter in the opposite directions. This raises that the need for an SON COordinator (SONCO) meant to arbitrate the parameter change requests of the SON functions, ensuring some degree of fairness. It is difficult to anticipate the impact of accepting several simultaneous requests. In this paper, we provide a SONCO design based on reinforcement learning (RL) as it allows us to learn from previous experiences and improve our future decisions. Typically, RL algorithms are complex. To reduce this complexity, we employ two flavors of function approximation and provide a study-case. Results show that the proposed SONCO design is capable of biasing this fairness among the SON functions by means of weights attributed to the SON functions. Also, we evaluate the tracking capability of the algorithms.},

pages={550-562}, 
abstract={The constant increase in wireless handheld devices and the prospect of billions of connected machines has led the cellular community to research many different technologies that can deliver a high data rate and quality of service to mobile users (MUs). One of the problems that is usually overlooked by the community is that more devices mean higher signaling necessary to coordinate transmission and to allocate resources effectively. In particular, channel state information (CSI) of the users' channels is necessary in order for the base station to assign frequency resources. On the other hand, this feedback (FB) information comes at a cost of uplink (UL) bandwidth, which is traditionally not considered. In this paper, we analyze the impact that reduced user FB information has on a Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network. A model, which considers the tradeoff between downlink (DL) performance and UL overhead, is presented. We introduce different FB-allocation strategies, which follow the same structure as the ones in the LTE standard, and study their effects on the network for varying number of users and different resource-allocation strategies. We show that dynamically allocating FB resources can be beneficial for the network. In order for the base station to determine which FB-allocation strategy is the most beneficial, in specific network conditions, we propose two reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. The first solution allows the base station to allocate one homogeneous FB strategy valid for all the users served, whereas the second more complex solution determines a different strategy for each user based on its channel conditions. The RL methods show that, even in dynamic scenarios, each base station is capable of determining an optimal operating point autonomously, hence optimally balancing FB overhead and benefits.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the PHY-layer authentication that exploits radio channel information (such as received signal strength indicators) to detect spoofing attacks in wireless networks. The interactions between a legitimate receiver and spoofers are formulated as a zero-sum authentication game. The receiver chooses the test threshold in the hypothesis test to maximize its utility based on the Bayesian risk in the spoofing detection, whereas the spoofers determine their attack frequencies to minimize the utility of the receiver. The Nash equilibrium of the static authentication game is derived, and its uniqueness is discussed. We also investigate a repeated PHY-layer authentication game for a dynamic radio environment. As it is challenging for the radio nodes to obtain the exact channel parameters in advance, we propose spoofing detection schemes based on Q-learning and Dyna-Q, which achieve the optimal test threshold in the spoofing detection via reinforcement learning. We implement the PHY-layer spoofing detectors over universal software radio peripherals and evaluate their performance via experiments in indoor environments. Both simulation and experimental results have validated the efficiency of the proposed strategies.},

abstract={This paper examines how flexible cellular system architectures and efficient spectrum management techniques can be used to play a key role in accommodating the exponentially increasing demand for mobile data capacity in the near future. The efficiency of the use of radio spectrum for wireless communications can be dramatically increased by dynamic secondary spectrum sharing; an intelligent approach that allows unlicensed devices access to those parts of the spectrum that are otherwise underutilized by the incumbent users. In this paper, we propose a heuristically accelerated reinforcement learning (HARL)-based framework, designed for dynamic secondary spectrum sharing in Long Term Evolution cellular systems. It utilizes a radio environment map as external information for guiding the learning process of cognitive cellular systems. System level simulations of a stadium temporary event scenario show that the schemes based on the proposed HARL framework achieve high controllability of spectrum sharing patterns in a fully autonomous way. This results in a significant decrease in the primary system quality of service degradation due to interference from the secondary cognitive systems, compared with a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning solution and a purely heuristic typical LTE solution. The spectrum sharing patterns that emerge by using the proposed schemes also result in remarkable reliability of the cognitive eNodeB on the aerial platform. Furthermore, the novel principle and the general structure of heuristic functions proposed in the context of HARL are applicable to a wide range of self-organization problems beyond the wireless communications domain.},

abstract={In this paper, a decentralized and self-organizing mechanism for small cell networks (such as micro-, femto- and picocells) is proposed. In particular, an application to the case in which small cell networks aim to mitigate the interference caused to the macrocell network, while maximizing their own spectral efficiencies, is presented. The proposed mechanism is based on new notions of reinforcement learning (RL) through which small cells jointly estimate their time-average performance and optimize their probability distributions with which they judiciously choose their transmit configurations. Here, a minimum signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) is guaranteed at the macrocell user equipment (UE), while the small cells maximize their individual performances. The proposed RL procedure is fully distributed as every small cell base station requires only an observation of its instantaneous performance which can be obtained from its UE. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed mechanism always converges to an epsilon Nash equilibrium when all small cells share the same interest. In addition, this mechanism is shown to possess better convergence properties and incur less overhead than existing techniques such as best response dynamics, fictitious play or classical RL. Finally, numerical results are given to validate the theoretical findings, highlighting the inherent tradeoffs facing small cells, namely exploration/exploitation, myopic/foresighted behavior and complete/incomplete information.},

We evaluate the effectiveness of a reinforcement learning algorithm by testing it with real spectrum occupancy data collected in the GSM, ISM, and DECT bands. Our results show that learning performance is highly correlated with the level of PU activity and the amount of structure in the use of spectrum. For low levels of PU activity and/or high complexity in its utilization of channels, reinforcement learning performs no better than simple random channel selection. We suggest that Lempel-Ziv complexity might be one of the features considered by a cognitive radio when deciding which channels to opportunistically explore.},

abstract={Mobile-broadband traffic has experienced a large increase over the past few years. Femtocells are envisioned to cope with such a demand of capacity in indoor environments. Since those small cells are low-cost nodes, a thorough deployment is not typically performed, particularly in enterprise scenarios. As a result, the matching between traffic demand and network resources is rarely optimal. In this paper, several load balancing techniques based on self-tuning of femtocell parameters are designed to solve localized congestion problems. In particular, these techniques are implemented by fuzzy logic controllers (FLC) and fuzzy rule-based reinforcement learning systems (FRLSs). Performance assessment is carried out in a dynamic system-level simulator. Results show that the combination of FLC and FRLS produces an increase in performance that is significantly higher than if techniques are implemented alone. Both the response time and the final value of performance indicators are improved.},

year={2012}, 
volume={30},

pages={54-69}, 
abstract={Cognitive radio (CR) users are expected to be uncoordinated users that opportunistically seek the spectrum resource from primary users (PUs) in a competitive way. In most existing works, however, CR users are required to share the interference channel information and power strategies to conduct the game with pricing mechanisms that incur the frequent exchange of information. The requirement of significant communication overheads among CR users impedes fully distributed solutions for the deployment of CR networks, which is a challenging problem in the research communities. In this paper, a robust distributed power control algorithm is designed with low implementation complexity for CR networks through reinforcement learning, which does not require the interference channel and power strategy information among CR users (and from CR users to PUs). To the best of our knowledge, this research provides the solution for the first time for the incomplete-information power control game in CR networks. During the repeated game, CR users can control their power strategies by observing the interference from the feedback signals of PUs and transmission rates obtained in the previous step. This procedure allows achieving high spectrum efficiency while conforming to the interference constraint of PUs. This constrained repeated stochastic game with learning automaton is proved to be asymptotically equivalence to the traditional game with complete information. The properties of existence, diagonal concavity and uniqueness for the game are studied. A Bush-Mosteller reinforcement learning procedure is designed for the power control algorithm, and the properties of convergence and learning rate of the algorithm are analyzed. The performance of the learning-based power control algorithm is thoroughly investigated with simulation results, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in solving variety of practical CR network problems for real-world applications.},

abstract={Optical burst switching (OBS) is a promising technology that exploits the benefits of optical communication and supports statistical multiplexing of data traffic at a fine granularity making it a suitable technology for the next generation Internet. Contention among the bursts that arrive simultaneously at a core node leads to burst loss which affects the throughput of higher layer traffic. Development of efficient algorithms for path selection and wavelength selection is crucial to minimize the burst loss probability (BLP) in OBS networks. In this paper, we formulate path selection and wavelength selection in OBS networks as a multi-armed bandit problem and discuss the difficulties to solve them optimally. We propose algorithms based on Q-learning to solve these problems near-optimally. At an egress node, the path selection algorithm evaluates the Q values for a set of precomputed paths and chooses a path that corresponds to minimum BLP. Similarly, Q-learning algorithm for wavelength selection selects a wavelength in a pre-routed path such that the BLP is minimized. We do not assume wavelength conversion and buffering at the core nodes and hence, selection of path and wavelength is done only at the edge nodes. We simulate the proposed algorithms under dynamic load to demonstrate that they reduce the BLP compared to the other adaptive algorithms available in the literature.},

abstract={We consider the problem of average throughput maximization per total consumed energy in packetized sensor communications. Our study results in a near-optimal transmission strategy that chooses the optimal modulation level and transmit power while adapting to the incoming traffic rate, buffer condition, and the channel condition. We investigate the point-to-point and multinode communication scenarios. Many solutions of the previous works require the state transition probability, which may be hard to obtain in a practical situation. Therefore, we are motivated to propose and utilize a class of learning algorithms [called reinforcement learning (RL)] to obtain the near-optimal policy in point-to-point communication and a good transmission strategy in multinode scenario. For comparison purpose, we develop the stochastic models to obtain the optimal strategy in the point-to-point communication. We show that the learned policy is close to the optimal policy. We further extend the algorithm to solve the optimization problem in a multinode scenario by independent learning. We compare the learned policy to a simple policy, where the agent chooses the highest possible modulation and selects the transmit power that achieves a predefined signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) given one particular modulation. The proposed learning algorithm achieves more than twice the throughput per energy compared with the simple policy, particularly, in high packet arrival regime. Beside the good performance, the RL algorithm results in a simple, systematic, self-organized, and distributed way to decide the transmission strategy.},

abstract={We solve the adaptive call admission control (CAC) problem in multimedia networks via reinforcement learning (RL). The problem requires that network revenue be maximized while simultaneously meeting quality of service (QoS) constraints that forbid entry into certain states and use of certain actions. We show that RL provides a solution to this constrained semi-Markov decision problem and is able to earn significantly higher revenues than alternative heuristics. Unlike other model-based algorithms, RL does not require the explicit state transition models to solve the decision problems. This feature is very important if one considers large integrated service networks supporting a number of different service types, where the number of states is so large that model-based optimization algorithms are infeasible. Both packet-level and call-level QoS constraints are addressed, and both conservative and aggressive approaches to the QoS constraints are considered. Results are demonstrated on a single link and extended to routing on a multilink network.},

First, computer simulation has been carried out in order to test stability and performance of the proposed RL controller before actual use. The proposed controller exhibited a good road tracking performance, especially on high-curvature roads. Then, the actual autonomous driving experiments successfully verified the control performance on campus roads in which there were shadows from the trees, noisy and/or broken lane markings, different road curvatures, and also different times of the day reflecting a range of lighting conditions.

abstract={The Energy Internet (EI) is an important infrastructure for effectively utilizing and intelligently managing renewable energy sources (RES). In this paper, we study the architecture design of the EI under the backdrop of large-scale RES grid connection and the efficient forecasting and optimal utilization of energy. The contribution of our work is threefold. First, we design a hierarchical integration architecture for the EI and attempt to solve the issues of energy and information management that stem from large-scale RES grid connection. Second, we propose a novel energy forecasting scheme that significantly reduces the amount of effort and ensures the accuracy of formulating the energy forecasting as an instance of the matrix completion issue. Third, we take electric vehicle charging as a typical case and propose the use of reinforcement learning to achieve optimal energy delivery. An experimental evaluation of real-world data sets validates the expectations of the study and highlights the superiorities of our proposed approaches.},

abstract={Reinforcement learning (RL) is an important machine learning paradigm that can be used for learning from the data obtained by the human–computer interface and the interaction in human-centered smart systems. One of the essential problems in RL algorithms is the value functions. Value functions are usually estimated via linearly parameterized value functions. Prior RL algorithms that generalize in this way required learning times tuning the linear weights leaving out the basis function. In fact, basis functions in value function approximation also have a significant influence on the performance. In this paper, a new adaptive policy evaluation network based on recursive least squares temporal difference (TD) with gradient correction (adaptive RC network) is proposed. Basis functions in the proposed algorithm were adaptive optimized, mainly aiming at the widths. In the proposed algorithm, TD error and value function were estimated by RC algorithm and value function approximation. The gradient derived from the squares of TD error was used to update the widths of basis functions. Therefore, the RC network can adjust its network parameters in an adaptive way with a self-organizing approach according to the progress in learning. Empirical results based on the three RL benchmarks show the performance and applicability of the proposed adaptive RC network.},

abstract={Due to the lack of resources in the low spectrum, LTE-U (LTE in unlicensed spectrum) technology has been proposed to extend LTE to unlicensed spectrum. LTE-U undertakes the task of streaming data traffic for licensed spectrum, which can greatly enhance the capacity of the system. However, the introduction of LTE-U technology also gives rise to the problem of coexistence with Wi-Fi systems. In this paper, an LTE-U and Wi-Fi coexistence algorithm (LWCA) is proposed in multi-channel scenarios based on Q-learning. By taking the idea of alternately transferring data in LTE-U and Wi-Fi, the algorithm takes into account both the fairness and the performance of the system and optimizes the duty cycle. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the throughput of the system in the premise of ensuring fairness.},

number={99}, 
pages={1-1}, 
abstract={This paper studies the delay-optimal virtual machine (VM) scheduling problem in cloud computing systems, which have a constant amount of infrastructure resources such as CPU, memory and storage in the resource pool. The cloud computing system provides VMs as services to users. Cloud users request various types of VMs randomly over time, and the requested VM-hosting durations vary vastly. We first adopt a queueing model for the heterogeneous and dynamic workloads. Then, we formulate the VM scheduling in such a queueing cloud computing system as a decision-making process, where the decision variable is the vector of VM configurations and the optimization objective is the delay performance in terms of average job completion time. A low-complexity online scheme that combines the shortest-job-first (SJF) buffering and min-min best fit (MMBF) scheduling algorithms, i.e., SJF-MMBF, is proposed to determine the solutions. Another scheme that combines the SJF buffering and reinforcement learning (RL)-based scheduling algorithms, i.e., SJF-RL, is further proposed to avoid the potential of job starvation in SJF-MMBF. The simulation results show that SJF-RL achieves its goal of delay-optimal scheduling of VMs by provisioning a low delay at various job arrival rates for various shapes of job length distributions. The simulation results also illustrate that although SJF-MMBF is sub-delay-optimal in a heavy-loaded and highly dynamic environment, it is efficient in throughput performance in terms of the average job hosting rate provisioning.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are vulnerable to smart attackers who are selfish and subjective end-users and use smart radio devices to change their attack types and policies based on the ongoing UAV transmission and network states. In this paper, we apply prospect theory to formulate a subjective smart attack game for the UAV transmission, in which a smart attacker Eve makes subjective decisions to choose the attack type such as jamming, spoofing and eavesdropping without knowing the attack detection accuracy of the UAV system and the UAV transmit power on multiple radio channels is chosen to resist smart attacks. Reinforcement learning based UAV power allocation strategies are proposed to achieve the optimal power allocation against smart attacks without knowing the attack model and the channel model in the dynamic game. A deep Q-learning based UAV power allocation strategy combines Qlearning and deep learning to accelerate the learning speed for the case with a large number of channel states and attack modes. Simulation results show that our proposed UAV power allocation strategy can suppress the attack motivation of subjective smart attackers and increase the secrecy capacity and the utility of the UAV system.},

abstract={This paper introduces an imitation system based on the similarity of the replaying motions of robots with the sequential poses of a demonstrator. The system is composed of three modules-key pose elicitation, real robot balance control, and memorization for motion replay. The elicitation of key poses drives the balance learning and motion replay of the robot. Dissimilarity values associated with the defined spatiotemporal function of simultaneous joint motion are used to analyze the degree of similarity. To overcome the difference in mechanical structures and kinematics, such as the number of joints between robots and human demonstrators, the key poses extracted from the motions of demonstrators are modified by a Q-Learning process that considers the kinematic constraints and maintains the balance of the robot while executing imitation. The rewards were designed not only to encourage a robot to execute as many consecutive poses as possible, but also to guide the robot to maintain its balance even though the biped lacks information on the ankle joint. These modified key poses are stored in databases for replaying or composing new motions in an ordered sequence. The experimental results demonstrate that a robot could adjust the poses, mapped from the movements of the demonstrator, to its static stable states, thereby imitating human motions by self-learning.},

year={2017}, 
volume={16},

pages={4866-4879}, 
abstract={To reap the benefits of cache-enabled small cell networks, new backaul management mechanisms are needed to prevent the predicted files that are downloaded at the small base stations (SBSs) for caching purposes from jeopardizing the urgent requests that need to be served via the backhaul. Such mechanisms must account for the heterogeneity of the backhaul that will encompass both wireless backhaul links (at various frequency bands) and a wired backhaul component. In this paper, the heterogeneous backhaul management problem is formulated as a minority game in which each SBS has to define the number of predicted files to download, without affecting the required transmission rate of the current requests. For the formulated game, it is shown that a unique fair proper mixed Nash equilibrium (PMNE) exists. A self-organizing reinforcement learning algorithm is then proposed and shown to converge to a unique Boltzmann-Gibbs equilibrium, which approximates the desired PMNE. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed approach can be close to that of the ideal optimal algorithm while it outperforms a centralized greedy approach in terms of the amount of data that is cached without jeopardizing the quality-of-service of current requests.},

abstract={In this paper, we study dynamic load-balancing spectrum decision for a cognitive radio network (CRN) that dynamically distributes packets from the secondary user (SU) to different available primary channels. We consider two different classes of services at the SU, i.e., delay sensitive (DS) and best effort (BE) services, and assign a higher priority to the DS services. We apply priority queuing model to address this priority issue in the CRN. Based on the queuing model, two Markov decision processes (MDPs) are formulated with objectives to minimize the average delay of both services while guaranteeing the priority of the DS services. Reinforcement learning is applied to find the optimal solutions when the traffic and channel characteristics are unknown. To address the computational complexity issue in the MDP solutions, we propose a myopic method based on the estimated packet sojourn time, which is derived by formulating a phase type distribution. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of all proposed algorithms for load-balancing spectrum decision. It also shows that the proposed myopic scheme can achieve significant reduction on computational complexity with a cost on the delay performance of low priority BE services.},

abstract={Human-robot interaction is a growing area of research as robotic applications expand into unstructured environments. However, much of the current research has focused on tasks involving limited degrees of freedom (DOF), while not allowing the human the ability to choose the DOF on which they wish to focus. In this paper, a controller that allows human-robot cooperation in six-DOF Cartesian space is presented, which allows the human to direct their focus as they desire. The developed scheme was tested using a virtual reality system while maintaining physical interaction with the robot. Overall, the subjects were 100% successful in completion of the tasks and were able to exchange leader/follower roles with the robot bidirectionally. In addition, a reinforcement learning algorithm was shown to decrease the estimated mechanical power applied by the human to exchange roles. The latter proves the efficiency of the proposed scheme and makes it a strong candidate for applications that involve sophisticated human-robot interaction in collaborative tasks found in a plethora of cases, e.g., industry, manufacturing, semi-autonomous driving, and so on.},

abstract={One of the many problems faced by current cellular network technology is the underutilization of the dedicated licensed spectrum of network operators. An emerging paradigm to solve this issue is to allow multiple operators to share some parts of each other's spectrum. Previous works on spectrum sharing have failed to integrate the theoretical insights provided by recent developments in stochastic geometrical approaches to cellular network analysis with the objectives of network resource allocation problems. In this paper, we study the non-orthogonal spectrum assignment with the goal of maximizing the social welfare of the network, defined as the expected weighted sum rate of the operators. We adopt the many-to-one stable matching game framework to tackle this problem. Moreover, using the stochastic geometrical approach, we show that its solution can be both stable as well as socially optimal. To obtain the maxima of social welfare, the computation of the game theoretical solution using the generic Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is proposed. We also investigate the role of power allocation schemes using Q-learning, and we numerically show that the effect of resource allocation scheme is much more significant than the effect of power allocation for the social welfare of the system.},

abstract={In a cooperative network, the user equipment (UE) shares information for cooperatively achieving a common goal. However, owing to the concerns of privacy or cost, UEs may be reluctant to share genuine information, which raises the information credibility problem addressed. Diverse techniques have been proposed for enhancing the information credibility in various scenarios. However, there is a paucity of information on modeling the UEs' decision making behavior, namely as to whether they are willing/able to share genuine information, even though this directly affects the information credibility across the network. Hence, we propose a game theoretic framework for the associated information credibility modeling by taking into account the users' information sharing strategies and utilities. This framework is investigated under both a homogeneous model and a heterogeneous model. The spontaneous information credibility equilibria of both models are derived and analyzed, including the closed-form analysis of the homogeneous model based on a sophisticated evolutionary game model and on the reinforcement learning-based analysis of the heterogeneous model. Moreover, a credit mechanism is designed for encouraging the UEs to share genuine information. Experimental results relying on real-world data traces support our utility function formulation, while our simulation results verify the theoretical analysis and show that all the UEs are encouraged by the proposed algorithm to share genuine information with a probability of one, when a credit mechanism is invoked. The proposed modeling techniques may be applied in diverse cooperative networks, including classic wireless networks, vehicular networks, as well as social networks.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the authentication based on radio channel information in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems and formulate the interactions between a receiver with multiple antennas and a spoofing node as a zero-sum physical (PHY)-layer authentication game. In this game, the receiver chooses the test threshold of the hypothesis test to maximize its Bayesian risk-based utility in the spoofing detection, while the adversary chooses its attack rate, i.e., how often a spoofing signal is sent. We derive the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the static PHY-layer authentication game and present the condition that the NE exists, showing that both the spoofing detection error rates and the spoofing rate decrease with the number of transmit and receive antennas. We propose a PHY-layer spoofing detection algorithm for MIMO systems based on Q-learning, in which the receiver applies the reinforcement learning technique to achieve the optimal test threshold via trials in a dynamic game without knowing the system parameters, such as the channel time variation and spoofing cost. We also use Dyna architecture and prioritized sweeping (Dyna-PS) to improve the spoofing detection in time-variant radio environments. The proposed authentication algorithms are implemented over universal software radio peripherals and evaluated via experiments in an indoor environment. Experimental results show that the Dyna-PS-based spoofing detection algorithm further reduces the spoofing detection error rates and increases the utility of the receiver compared with the Q-learning-based algorithm, and both performances improve with more number of transmit or receive antennas.},

abstract={Vehicular crowdsensing takes advantage of the mobility of vehicles to provide location-based services in large-scale areas. In this paper, mobile crowdsensing (MCS) in vehicular networks is analyzed and the interactions between a crowdsensing server and vehicles equipped with sensors in an area of interest is formulated as a vehicular crowdsensing game. Each participating vehicle chooses its sensing strategy based on the sensing cost, radio channel state, and the expected payment. The MCS server evaluates the accuracy of each sensing report and pays the vehicle accordingly. The Nash equilibrium of the static vehicular crowdsensing game is derived for both accumulative sensing tasks and best-quality sensing tasks, showing the tradeoff between the sensing accuracy and the overall payment by the MCS server. A Q-learning-based MCS payment strategy and sensing strategy is proposed for the dynamic vehicular crowdsensing game, and a postdecision state learning technique is applied to exploit the known radio channel model to accelerate the learning speed of each vehicle. Simulations based on a Markov-chain channel model are performed to verify the efficiency of the proposed MCS system, showing that it outperforms the benchmark MCS system in terms of the average utility, the sensing accuracy, and the energy consumption of the vehicles.},

abstract={Due to the scarcity of the licensed spectrum allocated for mobile communication systems, licensed-assisted access long-term evolution (LAA-LTE) network is recently proposed to deploy in unlicensed spectrum, which is currently occupied by different Wi-Fi systems. It is a very challenging problem to ensure fair coexistence between LAA-LTE and Wi-Fi networks, in terms of spectrum sharing and traffic management. To solve this problem, a fair downlink traffic management (FDTM) scheme is proposed in this paper for hybrid LAA-LTE/Wi-Fi networks. FDTM aims to tune the minimum contention window (CWmin) values and assigns feasible weights for the LAA eNBs with different traffic loads, thus to achieve; 1) fair spectrum sharing with the coexisting Wi-Fi networks in unlicensed spectrum and 2) fair service differentiation for downlink LAA-LTE traffic. Numerical results show our FDTM scheme can guarantee the throughput performance of Wi-Fi networks in shared unlicensed spectrum while supporting proportional fairness for the LAA eNBs with different traffic loads.},

abstract={Uplink-downlink decoupling in which users can be associated to different base stations in the uplink and downlink of heterogeneous small cell networks (SCNs) has attracted significant attention recently. However, most existing works focus on simple association mechanisms in LTE SCNs that operate only in the licensed band. In contrast, in this paper, the problem of resource allocation with uplink-downlink decoupling is studied for an SCN that incorporates LTE in the unlicensed band. Here, the users can access both licensed and unlicensed bands while being associated to different base stations. This problem is formulated as a noncooperative game that incorporates user association, spectrum allocation, and load balancing. To solve this problem, a distributed algorithm based on the machine learning framework of echo state networks (ESNs) is proposed. This proposed algorithm allows the small base stations to autonomously choose their optimal resource allocation strategies given only limited information on the network's and users' states. It is shown that the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary mixed-strategy distribution, which constitutes a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for their studied game. Simulation results show that the proposed approach yields significant gain, in terms of the sum-rate of the 50th percentile of users, that reaches up to 167% compared with a Q-learning algorithm. The results also show that the ESN significantly provides a considerable reduction of information exchange for the wireless network.},

abstract={In vehicular networks, information dissemination/sharing among vehicles is of salient importance. Although diverse mechanisms have been proposed in the existing literature, the related information credibility issues have not been investigated. Against this background, in this paper, we propose a credible information-sharing mechanism capable of ensuring that the vehicles do share genuine road traffic information (RTI). We commence with the outage-probability analysis of information sharing in vehicular networks under both a general scenario and a specific highway scenario. Closed-form expressions are derived for both scenarios, given the specific channel settings. Based on the outage-probability expressions, we formulate the utility of RTI sharing and design an algorithm for promoting the sharing of genuine RTI. To verify our theoretical analysis and the proposed mechanism, we invoke a real-world dataset containing the locations of Beijing taxis to conduct our simulations.

abstract={We consider cooperative communications with energy harvesting (EH) relays and develop a distributed power control mechanism for the relaying terminals. Unlike prior work, which mainly deals with single-relay systems with saturated traffic flow, we address the case of bursty data arrival at the source cooperatively forwarded by multiple half-duplex EH relays. We aim at optimizing the long-run average delay of the source packets under the energy neutrality constraint on the power consumption of each relay. While EH relay systems have been predominantly optimized using either offline or online methodologies, we take on a more realistic learning-theoretic approach. Hence, our scheme can be deployed for real-time operation without assuming acausal information on channel realizations, data/energy arrivals as required by offline optimization, or relying on precise statistics of the system processes, as is the case with online optimization. We formulate the problem as a partially observable identical payoff stochastic game (PO-IPSG) with factored controllers in which the power control policy of each relay is adaptive to its channel and energy states as well as to the state of the source buffer. We equip each relay with a reinforcement learning procedure and prove that the parallel execution of this procedure is convergent to (at least) a locally optimal solution of the formulated PO-IPSG. The proposed algorithm operates without explicit message exchanges between the relays, while inducing only little source-relay signaling overhead. By simulation, we contrast the delay performance of the proposed method against existing heuristics for throughput maximization. It is shown that compared with these heuristics, the systematic approach adopted in this paper has a smaller suboptimality gap once evaluated against a centralized optimal policy armed with perfect statistics.},

abstract={This paper presents a method for the biped dynamic walking and balance control using reinforcement learning, which learns dynamic walking without a priori knowledge about the dynamic model. The learning architecture developed is aimed to solve complex control problems in robotic actuation control by mapping the action space from a discretized domain to a continuous one. It employs the discrete actions to construct a policy for continuous action. The architecture allows for the scaling of the dimensionality of the state space and cardinality of the action set that represents new knowledge, or new requirements for a desired task. The balance learning method utilizing the motion of robot arm and leg to shift the zero moment point on the soles of a robot can maintain the biped robot in a static stable state. This balanced algorithm is applied to biped walking on a flat surface and a seesaw and is making the biped's walks more stable. The simulation shows that the proposed method can allow the robot to learn to improve its behavior in terms of walking speed. Finally, the methods are implemented on a physical biped robot to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed learning scheme.},

abstract={5G definition and standardization projects are well underway, and governing characteristics and major challenges have been identified. A critical network element impacting the potential performance of 5G networks is the backhaul, which is expected to expand in length and breadth to cater to the exponential growth of small cells while offering high throughput in the order of gigabit per second and less than 1 ms latency with high resilience and energy efficiency. Such performance may only be possible with direct optical fiber connections that are often not available country-wide and are cumbersome and expensive to deploy. On the other hand, a prime 5G characteristic is diversity, which describes the radio access network, the backhaul, and also the types of user applications and devices. Thus, we propose a novel, distributed, self-optimized, end-to-end user-cell-backhaul association scheme that intelligently associates users with candidate cells based on corresponding dynamic radio and backhaul conditions while abiding by users' requirements. Radio cells broadcast multiple bias factors, each reflecting a dynamic performance indicator (DPI) of the end-to-end network performance such as capacity, latency, resilience, energy consumption, and so on. A given user would employ these factors to derive a user-centric cell ranking that motivates it to select the cell with radio and backhaul performance that conforms to the user requirements. Reinforcement learning is used at the radio cells to optimise the bias factors for each DPI in a way that maximise the system throughput while minimising the gap between the users' achievable and required end-to-end quality of experience (QoE). Preliminary results show considerable improvement in users' QoE and cumulative system throughput when compared with the state-of-the-art user-cell association schemes.},

abstract={Learning models of artificial intelligence can nowadays perform very well on a large variety of tasks. However, in practice, different task environments are best handled by different learning models, rather than a single universal approach. Most non-trivial models thus require the adjustment of several to many learning parameters, which is often done on a case-by-case basis by an external party. Meta-learning refers to the ability of an agent to autonomously and dynamically adjust its own learning parameters or meta-parameters. In this paper, we show how projective simulation, a recently developed model of artificial intelligence, can naturally be extended to account for meta-learning in reinforcement learning settings. The projective simulation approach is based on a random walk process over a network of clips. The suggested meta-learning scheme builds upon the same design and employs clip networks to monitor the agent's performance and to adjust its meta-parameters on the fly. We distinguish between reflex-type adaptation and adaptation through learning, and show the utility of both approaches. In addition, a trade-off between flexibility and learning-time is addressed. The extended model is examined on three different kinds of reinforcement learning tasks, in which the agent has different optimal values of the meta-parameters, and is shown to perform well, reaching near-optimal to optimal success rates in all of them, without ever needing to manually adjust any meta-parameter.},

abstract={Consider a transmission scheme with a single transmitter and multiple receivers over a faulty broadcast channel. For each receiver, the transmitter has a unique infinite stream of packets, and its goal is to deliver them at the highest throughput possible. While such multiple-unicast models are unsolved in general, several network coding-based schemes were suggested. In such schemes, the transmitter can either send an uncoded packet, or a coded packet which is the function of a few packets. The packets sent can be received by the designated receiver (with some probability) or heard and stored by other receivers. Two functional modes are considered; the first presumes that the storage time is unlimited, while in the second one it is limited by the given time to expire (TTE) parameter. We model the transmission process as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP). Since the large state space renders exact solutions computationally impractical, we introduce policy-restricted and induced MDPs with significantly reduced state space, and prove that with proper reward function they have equal optimal value function (hence equal optimal throughput). We then derive a reinforcement learning algorithm, which learns the optimal policy for the induced MDP. This optimal strategy of the induced MDP, once applied to the policy of the restricted one, significantly improves over uncoded schemes. Next, we enhance the algorithm by means of analysis of the structural properties of the resulting cost functional. We demonstrate that our method scales well in the number of users, and automatically adapts to the packet loss rates, unknown in advance. In addition, the performance is compared to the recent bound by Wang, which assumes much stronger coding (e.g., intrasession and buffering of coded packets), yet is shown to be comparable},

abstract={The introduction of heterogeneous wireless mesh technologies provides an opportunity for higher network capacity, wider coverage, and higher quality of service (QoS). Each wireless device utilizes different standards, data formats, protocols, and access technologies. However, the diversity and complexity of such technologies create challenges for traditional control and management systems. This paper proposes a heterogeneous metropolitan area network architecture that combines an IEEE 802.11 wireless mesh network (WMN) with a long-term evolution (LTE) network. In addition, a new heterogeneous routing protocol and a routing algorithm based on reinforcement learning called cognitive heterogeneous routing are proposed to select the appropriate transmission technology based on parameters from each network. The proposed heterogeneous network overcomes the problems of sending packets over long paths, island nodes, and interference in WMNs and increases the overall capacity of the combined network by utilizing unlicensed frequency bands instead of buying more license frequency bands for LTE. The work is validated through extensive simulations that indicate that the proposed heterogeneous WMN outperforms the LTE and Wi-Fi networks when used individually. The simulation results show that the proposed network achieves an increase of up to 200% in throughput compared with Wi-Fi-only networks or LTE-only networks.},

abstract={Most existing multi-hop broadcast protocols for vehicular ad hoc networks do not consider the problem of how to adapt transmission parameters according to the network environment. Besides the propagation environment that determines the channel bit error rate, packet payload size has a significant effect on the packet loss rate. In this paper, we first discuss the effect of packet size on the packet reception ratio, and then propose a broadcast protocol that is able to specify the best relay node by taking into account the data payload size. The proposed protocol employs a fuzzy logic-based algorithm to jointly consider multiple metrics (link quality, inter-vehicle distance, and vehicle mobility) and uses a redundancy transmission approach to ensure high reliability. Since the fuzzy membership functions are tuned by using reinforcement learning, the protocol can adapt to various network scenarios. We use both real-world experiments and computer simulations to evaluate the proposed protocol.},

abstract={The dynamic and unpredictable nature of energy harvesting sources available for wireless sensor networks, and the time variation in network statistics like packet transmission rates and link qualities, necessitate the use of adaptive duty cycling techniques. Such adaptive control allows sensor nodes to achieve long-run energy neutrality, where energy supply and demand are balanced in a dynamic environment such that the nodes function continuously. In this paper, we develop a new framework enabling an adaptive duty cycling scheme for sensor networks that takes into account the node battery level, ambient energy that can be harvested, and application-level QoS requirements. We model the system as a Markov decision process (MDP) that modifies its state transition policy using reinforcement learning. The MDP uses continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs) to model the network state of a node to obtain key QoS metrics like latency, loss probability, and power consumption, as well as to model the node battery level taking into account physically feasible rates of change. We show that with an appropriate choice of the reward function for the MDP, as well as a suitable learning rate, exploitation probability, and discount factor, the need to maintain minimum QoS levels for optimal network performance can be balanced with the need to promote the maintenance of a finite battery level to ensure node operability. Extensive simulation results show the benefit of our algorithm for different reward functions and parameters.},

abstract={When several radio access technologies (e.g., HSPA, LTE, WiFi, and WiMAX) cover the same region, deciding to which one mobiles connect is known as the Radio Access Technology (RAT) selection problem. To reduce network signaling and processing load, decisions are generally delegated to mobile users. Mobile users aim to selfishly maximize their utility. However, as they do not cooperate, their decisions may lead to performance inefficiency. In this paper, to overcome this limitation, we propose a network-assisted approach. The network provides information for the mobiles to make more accurate decisions. By appropriately tuning network information, user decisions are globally expected to meet operator objectives, avoiding undesirable network states. Deriving network information is formulated as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP), and optimal policies are computed using the Policy Iteration algorithm. Also, and since network parameters may not be easily obtained, a reinforcement learning approach is introduced to derive what to signal to mobiles. The performances of optimal, learning-based, and heuristic policies, such as blocking probability and average throughput, are analyzed. When tuning thresholds are pertinently set, our heuristic achieves performance very close to the optimal solution. Moreover, although it provides lower performance, our learning-based algorithm has the crucial advantage of requiring no prior parameterization.},

abstract={Cooperative communication exploits spatial diversity via relay node antennas to increase data rates in wireless networks. Relay node selection, therefore, plays a critical role in system performance. This paper examines the problem of relay node selection in cooperative networks, in which one relay node can be used by multiple source-destination transmission pairs, and all transmission pairs share the same set of relay nodes. Centralized approaches may exhibit higher complexity when the number of source nodes is increased. This paper gives source nodes self-optimizing and self-learning abilities and enables them to autonomously select relay nodes. A fully distributed approach, called a “Decentralized Learning-based Relay Assignment” (DLRA) algorithm, is proposed to achieve this goal. DLRA uses a reinforcement learning technique called stochastic learning automata, with each source node attaining the self-learning ability to find an appropriate relay node according to environmental feedback. This paper shows the convergency, optimality, and performance of DLRA via mathematical analysis and evaluates the performance of DLRA in two different network systems: a cooperative ad hoc network and a Long-Term Evolution (LTE)-Advanced relay network. The experimental results present several properties of DLRA: the effectiveness of DLRA in cooperative communication systems, the significant improvements made by DLRA in fairness, and the capacity of each node in LTE-Advanced systems.},

year={2015}, 
volume={33}, 
number={4}, 
pages={627-640}, 
abstract={This paper first provides a brief survey on existing traffic offloading techniques in wireless networks. Particularly as a case study, we put forward an online reinforcement learning framework for the problem of traffic offloading in a stochastic heterogeneous cellular network (HCN), where the time-varying traffic in the network can be offloaded to nearby small cells. Our aim is to minimize the total discounted energy consumption of the HCN while maintaining the quality-of-service (QoS) experienced by mobile users. For each cell (i.e., a macro cell or a small cell), the energy consumption is determined by its system load, which is coupled with system loads in other cells due to the sharing over a common frequency band. We model the energy-aware traffic offloading problem in such HCNs as a discrete-time Markov decision process (DTMDP). Based on the traffic observations and the traffic offloading operations, the network controller gradually optimizes the traffic offloading strategy with no prior knowledge of the DTMDP statistics. Such a model-free learning framework is important, particularly when the state space is huge. In order to solve the curse of dimensionality, we design a centralized Q-learning with compact state representation algorithm, which is named QC-learning. Moreover, a decentralized version of the QC-learning is developed based on the fact the macro base stations (BSs) can independently manage the operations of local small-cell BSs through making use of the global network state information obtained from the network controller. Simulations are conducted to show the effectiveness of the derived centralized and decentralized QC-learning algorithms in balancing the tradeoff between energy saving and QoS satisfaction.},

We develop a mixed preemptive and non-preemptive resume priority (PRP/NPRP) M/G/1 queueing model for modeling the spectrum usage behavior for prioritized multimedia applications. Then, a mathematical framework is formulated to analyze the performance of SUs. We apply the reinforcement learning to our QoE-driven spectrum handoff scheme to maximize the quality of video transmissions in the long term. The proposed learning scheme is asymptotically optimal, model-free, and can adaptively perform spectrum handoff for the changing channel conditions and traffic load.

abstract={In this paper, we focus on inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) techniques in heterogeneous network (HetNet) deployments, whereby macro- and picocells autonomously optimize their downlink transmissions with loose coordination. We model this strategic coexistence as a multi-agent system, aiming at joint interference management and cell association. Using tools from Reinforcement Learning (RL), agents (i.e., macro- and picocells) sense their environment and self-adapt based on local information to maximize their network performance. Specifically, we explore both time- and frequency domain ICIC scenarios and propose a two-level RL formulation. Here, picocells learn their optimal cell range expansion (CRE) bias and transmit power allocation, as well as appropriate frequency bands for multi-flow transmissions, in which a user equipment (UE) can be simultaneously served by two or more base stations (BSs) from macro- and pico-layers. To substantiate our theoretical findings, Long-Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) based system-level simulations are carried out in which our proposed approaches are compared with a number of baseline approaches, such as resource partitioning (RP), static CRE, and single-flow Carrier Aggregation (CA).

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the power control problem in a cooperative network with multiple wireless transmitters, multiple amplify-and-forward relays, and one destination. The relay communication can be either full duplex or half-duplex, and all source nodes interfere with each other at every intermediate relay node, and all active nodes (transmitters and relay nodes) interfere with each other at the base station. A game-theory-based power control algorithm is devised to allocate the powers among all active nodes. The source nodes aim at maximizing their energy efficiency (in bits per Joule per Hertz), whereas the relays aim at maximizing the network sum rate. We show that the proposed game admits multiple pure/mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium points. A Q-learning-based algorithm is then formulated to let the active players converge to the best Nash equilibrium point that combines good performance in terms of both energy efficiency and overall data rate. Numerical results show that the full-duplex scheme outperforms half-duplex configuration, Nash bargaining solution, the max-min fairness, and the max-rate optimization schemes in terms of energy efficiency, and outperforms the half-duplex mode, Nash bargaining system, and the max-min fairness scheme in terms of network sum rate.},

abstract={Based on the Gauss-Markov channel model, we investigate the stochastic feedback control for transmit beamforming in multiple-input-single-output systems and design practical implementation algorithms leveraging techniques in dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. We first validate the Markov decision process formulation of the underlying feedback control problem with a 4R-variable (4R-V) state, where R is the number of the transmit antennas. Due to the high complexity of finding an optimal feedback policy under the 4R-V state, we consider a reduced 2-V state. As opposed to a previous study that assumes the feedback problem under such a 2-V state remaining an MDP formulation, our analysis indicates that the underlying problem is no longer an MDP. Nonetheless, the approximation as an MDP is shown to be justifiable and efficient. Based on the quantized 2-V state and the MDP approximation, we propose practical implementation algorithms for feedback control with unknown state transition probabilities. In particular, we provide model-based offline and online learning algorithms, as well as a model-free learning algorithm. We investigate and compare these algorithms through extensive simulations and provide their efficiency analysis. According to these results, the application rule of these algorithms is established under both statistically stable and unstable channels.},

abstract={We address the challenge of energy efficiency in hierarchical spectrum sharing networks with dynamic traffic. We consider a primary and a cognitive secondary transmitter-receiver pair, where the secondary transmitter can utilize cooperative transmission to relay primary traffic while superimposing its own information. The secondary user meets a dilemma in this scenario. By choosing cooperation, it can transmit a packet immediately, but it has to bear the additional cost of relaying. Otherwise, it can wait for the primary user to become idle, which increases the queuing delay that secondary packets experience. To solve this dilemma and trade off delay and energy consumption, we propose dynamic cooperative secondary access control that takes the state of the spectrum sharing network into account. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and prove the existence of a stationary policy that is average cost optimal. We evaluate reinforcement learning to find optimal transmission strategy when the traffic and link statistics are not known. We demonstrate that dynamic cooperation is necessary for the secondary system to be able to adapt to changing network conditions and show that optimal sequential decision can significantly improve the tradeoff of the energy consumption and the delay.},

abstract={Recent works have validated the possibility of improving energy efficiency in radio access networks (RANs), achieved by dynamically turning on/off some base stations (BSs). In this paper, we extend the research over BS switching operations, which should match up with traffic load variations. Instead of depending on the dynamic traffic loads which are still quite challenging to precisely forecast, we firstly formulate the traffic variations as a Markov decision process. Afterwards, in order to foresightedly minimize the energy consumption of RANs, we design a reinforcement learning framework based BS switching operation scheme. Furthermore, to speed up the ongoing learning process, a transfer actor-critic algorithm (TACT), which utilizes the transferred learning expertise in historical periods or neighboring regions, is proposed and provably converges. In the end, we evaluate our proposed scheme by extensive simulations under various practical configurations and show that the proposed TACT algorithm contributes to a performance jump start and demonstrates the feasibility of significant energy efficiency improvement at the expense of tolerable delay performance.},

abstract={The design of distributed mechanisms for interference management is one of the key challenges in emerging wireless small cell networks whose backhaul is capacity limited and heterogeneous (wired, wireless and a mix thereof). In this paper, a novel, backhaul-aware approach to interference management in wireless small cell networks is proposed. The proposed approach enables macrocell user equipments (MUEs) to optimize their uplink performance, by exploiting the presence of neighboring small cell base stations. The problem is formulated as a noncooperative game among the MUEs that seek to optimize their delay-rate tradeoff, given the conditions of both the radio access network and the - possibly heterogeneous - backhaul. To solve this game, a novel, distributed learning algorithm is proposed using which the MUEs autonomously choose their optimal uplink transmission strategies, given a limited amount of available information. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is shown and its properties are studied. Simulation results show that, under various types of backhauls, the proposed approach yields significant performance gains, in terms of both average throughput and delay for the MUEs, when compared to existing benchmark algorithms.},

pages={877-889}, 
abstract={Various spectrum management schemes have been proposed in recent years to improve the spectrum utilization in cognitive radio networks. However, few of them have considered the existence of cognitive attackers who can adapt their attacking strategy to the time-varying spectrum environment and the secondary users' strategy. In this paper, we investigate the security mechanism when secondary users are facing the jamming attack, and propose a stochastic game framework for anti-jamming defense. At each stage of the game, secondary users observe the spectrum availability, the channel quality, and the attackers' strategy from the status of jammed channels. According to this observation, they will decide how many channels they should reserve for transmitting control and data messages and how to switch between the different channels. Using the minimax-Q learning, secondary users can gradually learn the optimal policy, which maximizes the expected sum of discounted payoffs defined as the spectrum-efficient throughput. The proposed stationary policy in the anti-jamming game is shown to achieve much better performance than the policy obtained from myopic learning, which only maximizes each stage's payoff, and a random defense strategy, since it successfully accommodates the environment dynamics and the strategic behavior of the cognitive attackers.},

abstract={Multi-hop wireless networks can provide flexible network infrastructures at a low cost. However, most existing wireless networking solutions are designed for delay-insensitive applications, thereby resulting in poor performance when handling delay-sensitive applications. Traditionally, network design problems are formulated as static optimizations, by assuming the network characteristics remain static. However, these solutions are not optimal when the environments are dynamic. Recently, several research works apply machine learning to maximize the performance of multi-hop wireless networks in dynamic environments, but they either only focus on determining policies at the network layer, without considering the lower-layers' actions, or use centralized learning approaches, which are inefficient for delay-sensitive applications, due to the large delay when propagating messages throughout the network. We propose in this paper a new solution that enables the nodes to autonomously determine their routing and transmission power to maximize the network utility, in a dynamic environment. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process, and propose a distributed computation of the optimal policy. Moreover, we use reinforcement-learning to find the optimized policy when the dynamics are unknown. We explicitly consider the impact of the information overhead on the network performance, and propose several novel algorithms to reduce the information overhead.},

pages={728-741}, 
abstract={In this paper, we study how to optimize the transmission decisions of nodes aimed at supporting mission-critical applications, such as surveillance, security monitoring, and military operations, etc. We focus on a network scenario where multiple source nodes transmit simultaneously mission-critical data through relay nodes to one or multiple destinations in multi-hop wireless Mission-Critical Networks (MCN). In such a network, the wireless nodes can be modeled as agents that can acquire local information from their neighbors and, based on this available information, can make timely transmission decisions to minimize the end-to-end delays of the mission-critical applications. Importantly, the MCN needs to cope in practice with the time-varying network dynamics. Hence, the agents need to make transmission decisions by considering not only the current network status, but also how the network status evolves over time, and how this is influenced by the actions taken by the nodes. We formulate the agents' autonomic decision making problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and construct a distributed MDP framework, which takes into consideration the informationally-decentralized nature of the multi-hop MCN. We further propose an online model-based reinforcement learning approach for agents to solve the distributed MDP at runtime, by modeling the network dynamics using priority queuing. We compare the proposed model-based reinforcement learning approach with other model-free reinforcement learning approaches in the MCN. The results show that the proposed model-based reinforcement learning approach for mission-critical applications not only outperforms myopic approaches without learning capability, but also outperforms conventional model-free reinforcement learning approaches.},

abstract={In this paper, we model the various users in a wireless network (e.g., cognitive radio network) as a collection of selfish autonomous agents that strategically interact to acquire dynamically available spectrum opportunities. Our main focus is on developing solutions for wireless users to successfully compete with each other for the limited and time-varying spectrum opportunities, given experienced dynamics in the wireless network. To analyze the interactions among users given the environment disturbance, we propose a stochastic game framework for modeling how the competition among users for spectrum opportunities evolves over time. At each stage of the stochastic game, a central spectrum moderator (CSM) auctions the available resources, and the users strategically bid for the required resources. The joint bid actions affect the resource allocation and, hence, the rewards and future strategies of all users. Based on the observed resource allocations and corresponding rewards, we propose a best-response learning algorithm that can be deployed by wireless users to improve their bidding policy at each stage. The simulation results show that by deploying the proposed best-response learning algorithm, the wireless users can significantly improve their own bidding strategies and, hence, their performance in terms of both the application quality and the incurred cost for the used resources.},

volume={57},

pages={1899-1909}, 
abstract={Future wireless networks are designed to support adaptive multimedia by controlling individual ongoing flows to increase or decrease their bandwidths in response to changes in traffic load. There is growing interest in quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning under this adaptive multimedia framework, in which a bandwidth adaptation algorithm needs to be used in conjunction with the call admission control algorithm. This paper presents a novel method for QoS provisioning via average reward reinforcement learning in conjunction with stochastic approximation, which can maximize the network revenue subject to several predetermined QoS constraints. Unlike other model-based algorithms (e.g., linear programming), our scheme does not require explicit state transition probabilities, and therefore, the assumptions behind the underlying system model are more realistic than those in previous schemes. In addition, when we consider the status of neighboring cells, the proposed scheme can dynamically adapt to changes in traffic condition. Moreover, the algorithm can control the bandwidth adaptation frequency effectively by accounting for the cost of bandwidth switching in the model. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using simulation results in adaptive multimedia wireless networks.},

abstract={For a seamless deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT), there is a need for self-organizing solutions to overcome key IoT challenges that include data processing, resource management, coexistence with existing wireless networks, and improved IoT-wide event detection. One of the most promising solutions to address these challenges is via the use of innovative learning frameworks that will enable the IoT devices to operate autonomously in a dynamic environment. However, developing learning mechanisms for the IoT requires coping with unique IoT properties in terms of resource constraints, heterogeneity, and strict quality-of-service requirements. In this paper, a number of emerging learning frameworks suitable for IoT applications are presented. In particular, the advantages, limitations, IoT applications, and key results pertaining to machine learning, sequential learning, and reinforcement learning are studied. For each type of learning, the computational complexity, required information, and learning performance are discussed. Then, to handle the heterogeneity of the IoT, a new framework based on the powerful tools of cognitive hierarchy theory is introduced. This framework is shown to efficiently capture the different IoT device types and varying levels of available resources among the IoT devices. In particular, the different resource capabilities of IoT devices are mapped to different levels of rationality in cognitive hierarchy theory, thus enabling the IoT devices to use different learning frameworks depending on their available resources. Finally, key results on the use of cognitive hierarchy theory in the IoT are presented.},

abstract={Cloudlet is a new paradigm in mobile cloud computing to provide resources to nearby mobile users via one-hop wireless connections. In this paper, we leverage the social tie structure among mobile users to achieve mutually beneficial computation offloading decision making, and hence, enhance the system-wide performance. Drawing on a social group utility maximization (SGUM) framework, we cast users' decision making of whether to offload or not as a Socially aware computation offloading game (COG). We study the SGUM-based COG for both strong and weak information cases. For the strong information case, where each user has the knowledge of other users' actions and the perfect observation of its achieved social group utility, we show that there exists a socially aware Nash equilibrium (SNE). We then design a distributed algorithm to achieve the SNE and quantify its performance gap with respect to the social optimal solution. For the weak information case, where each user does not have the knowledge of other users' actions and observes a noise-corrupted social group utility, we develop a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm, which is shown to converge almost surely to an ϵ-SNE. The numerical results show that the computation offloading performance can be significantly enhanced by leveraging the social ties among the users.},

pages={3512-3527}, 
abstract={This paper studies stochastic power control problems over a fading channel, where the transmitter randomly harvests renewable energies from environment and stores them in a battery for future data transmissions. Moreover, data packets are assumed to arrive at the data queue of transmitter with constant rate μ. To incorporate delay quality-of-service guarantees, two delay constraint models are separately considered, namely average delay model with maximum average delay constraint and statistical delay model with maximum delay outage probability constraint. Under each delay constraint model, the stochastic power control problem aims at maximizing μ considering the randomness of channel fading and energy harvesting (EH) processes. The resulting optimization problems can be formulated as infinite-horizon Markov decision processes. Under average delay model, the optimal power control policy needs to keep track of current data queue-length state in addition to the battery state. On the other hand, under statistical delay model, a sufficiently large queue-length region is assumed, hence, the optimal policy does not depend on the data queue-length state. We study various structural properties of the optimal control policies and develop online power control algorithms that converge to the optimal solutions without requiring statistical knowledge of channel fading and EH processes. By defining and learning the so-called post-decision state-value functions, the proposed learning algorithms require less complexity and converge faster than the conventional reinforcement learning algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the online learning algorithms for different delay constraint models and EH settings.},

abstract={This paper uses big data and machine learning for the real-time management of Internet scale quality-of-service (QoS) route optimisation with an overlay network. Based on the collection of data sampled every 2 min over a large number of source-destinations pairs, we show that intercontinental Internet protocol (IP) paths are far from optimal with respect to QoS metrics such as end-to-end round-trip delay. We, therefore, develop a machine learning-based scheme that exploits large scale data collected from communicating node pairs in a multihop overlay network that uses IP between the overlay nodes, and selects paths that provide substantially better QoS than IP. Inspired from cognitive packet network protocol, it uses random neural networks with reinforcement learning based on the massive data that is collected, to select intermediate overlay hops. The routing scheme is illustrated on a 20-node intercontinental overlay network that collects some 2 × 106 measurements per week, and makes scalable distributed routing decisions. Experimental results show that this approach improves QoS significantly and efficiently.},

To deal with SSDF attacks and to incentivize secondary users (SUs) to behave well, a joint spectrum sensing and resource allocation (JSSRA) scheme in a CRN is proposed in this paper. The JSSRA problem is formulated as a weighted-proportional-fairness-based resource-allocation optimization problem under the constraint that the primary user (PU) network is sufficiently protected. The problem is decomposed into two subproblems, namely, the resource allocation subproblem and cooperative SU number decision subproblem, which are solved by the Lagrangian dual algorithm and the brute-force algorithm, respectively. Moreover, a user-selection method based on reinforcement learning is presented to select reliable SUs for cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS). In addition, the SU's trust degree is updated according to its behavior in CSS and is used in the sensed resource-allocation process. The key point of our proposed scheme is to make SUs improve the sensing reliability and prevent SUs from behaving maliciously by an incentive mechanism. Comprehensive performance evaluation is conducted by computer simulation. It is shown that the proposed JSSRA scheme deals with the SSDF attack well in cooperative sensing process to improve system robustness and achieves a significant system utility gain in resource allocation.},

abstract={Can an intelligent jammer learn and adapt to unknown environments in an electronic warfare-type scenario? In this paper, we answer this question in the positive, by developing a cognitive jammer that adaptively and optimally disrupts the communication between a victim transmitter-receiver pair. We formalize the problem using a multiarmed bandit framework where the jammer can choose various physical layer parameters such as the signaling scheme, power level and the on-off/pulsing duration in an attempt to obtain power efficient jamming strategies. We first present online learning algorithms to maximize the jamming efficacy against static transmitter-receiver pairs and prove that these algorithms converge to the optimal (in terms of the error rate inflicted at the victim and the energy used) jamming strategy. Even more importantly, we prove that the rate of convergence to the optimal jamming strategy is sublinear, i.e., the learning is fast in comparison to existing reinforcement learning algorithms, which is particularly important in dynamically changing wireless environments. Also, we characterize the performance of the proposed bandit-based learning algorithm against multiple static and adaptive transmitter-receiver pairs.},

abstract={Emergency navigation algorithms for evacuees in confined spaces typically treat all evacuees in a homogeneous manner, using a common metric to select the best exit paths. In this paper, we present a quality of service (QoS) driven routing algorithm to cater to the needs of different types of evacuees based on age, mobility, and level of resistance to fatigue and hazard. Spatial information regarding the location and the spread of hazards is also integrated into the routing metrics to avoid situations where evacuees may be directed toward hazardous zones. Furthermore, rather than persisting with a single decision algorithm during an entire evacuation process, we suggest that evacuees may adapt their course of action with regard to their ongoing physical condition and environment. A widely tested routing protocol known as the cognitive packet network with random neural networks and reinforcement learning are employed to collect information and provide advice to evacuees, and is beneficial in emergency navigation owing to its low computational complexity and its ability to handle multiple QoS metrics in its search for safe exit paths. The simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm, which is sensitive to the needs of evacuees, produces better results than the use of a single metric. Simulations also show that the use of dynamic grouping to adjust the evacuees' category, and routing algorithms that have regard for their on-going health conditions and mobility, can achieve higher survival rates.},

title={A Cell Outage Management Framework for Dense Heterogeneous Networks}, 
year={2016}, 
volume={65},

pages={2097-2113}, 
abstract={In this paper, we present a novel cell outage management (COM) framework for heterogeneous networks with split control and data planes-a candidate architecture for meeting future capacity, quality-of-service, and energy efficiency demands. In such an architecture, the control and data functionalities are not necessarily handled by the same node. The control base stations (BSs) manage the transmission of control information and user equipment (UE) mobility, whereas the data BSs handle UE data. An implication of this split architecture is that an outage to a BS in one plane has to be compensated by other BSs in the same plane. Our COM framework addresses this challenge by incorporating two distinct cell outage detection (COD) algorithms to cope with the idiosyncrasies of both data and control planes. The COD algorithm for control cells leverages the relatively larger number of UEs in the control cell to gather large-scale minimization-of-drive-test report data and detects an outage by applying machine learning and anomaly detection techniques. To improve outage detection accuracy, we also investigate and compare the performance of two anomaly-detecting algorithms, i.e., k-nearest-neighbor- and local-outlier-factor-based anomaly detectors, within the control COD. On the other hand, for data cell COD, we propose a heuristic Grey-prediction-based approach, which can work with the small number of UE in the data cell, by exploiting the fact that the control BS manages UE-data BS connectivity and by receiving a periodic update of the received signal reference power statistic between the UEs and data BSs in its coverage. The detection accuracy of the heuristic data COD algorithm is further improved by exploiting the Fourier series of the residual error that is inherent to a Grey prediction model. Our COM framework integrates these two COD algorithms with a cell outage compensation (COC) algorithm that can be applied to both planes. Our COC solution utilizes an actor-critic-- ased reinforcement learning algorithm, which optimizes the capacity and coverage of the identified outage zone in a plane, by adjusting the antenna gain and transmission power of the surrounding BSs in that plane. The simulation results show that the proposed framework can detect both data and control cell outage and compensate for the detected outage in a reliable manner.},

abstract={Interference is one of the most limiting factors when trying to achieve high spectral efficiency in the deployment of heterogeneous networks (HNs). In this paper, the HN is modeled as a layer of closed-access LTE femtocells (FCs) overlaid upon an LTE radio access network. Within the context of dynamic learning games, this work proposes a novel heterogeneous multiobjective fully distributed strategy based on a reinforcement learning (RL) model (CODIPAS-HRL) for FC self-configuration/optimization. The self-organization capability enables the FCs to autonomously and opportunistically sense the radio environment using different learning strategies and tune their parameters accordingly, in order to operate under restrictions of avoiding interference to both network tiers and satisfy certain quality-of-service requirements. The proposed model reduces the learning cost associated with each learning strategy. We also study the convergence behavior under different learning rates and derive a new accuracy metric in order to provide comparisons between the different learning strategies. The simulation results show the convergence of the learning model to a solution concept based on satisfaction equilibrium, under the uncertainty of the HN environment. We show that intra/inter-tier interference can be significantly reduced, thus resulting in higher cell throughputs.},

abstract={To ensure resilient and reliable meter data collection that is essential for the smart grid operation, we propose a QoS-oriented wireless routing scheme. Specifically tailored for the heterogeneity of the meter data traffic in the smart grid, we first design a novel utility function that not only jointly accounts for system throughput and transmission latency, but also allows for flexible tradeoff between the two with a strict transmission latency constraint, as desired by various smart meter applications. Then, we model the interactions among smart meter data concentrators as a mixed-strategy network formation game. To avoid potential information exchange which is not always practical in meter data collection scenario, a stochastic reinforcement learning algorithm with only private and incomplete information is proposed to solve the network formation problem. Such a problem formulation, together with our proposed stochastic learning algorithm on graph, results in a steady probabilistic route. Both contributions are novel and unique in comparison with existing work on this topic. Another distinct feature of our approach is its capability of effectively maintaining the QoS of smart meter data collection, even when the network is under fault or attack, as verified by simulations.},

volume={30},

pages={2285-2294}, 
abstract={We consider a wireless provider who caters to two classes of customers, namely primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs). PUs have long term contracts while SUs are admitted and priced according to current availability of excess spectrum. The average rate at which SUs attempt to access the spectrum is a function on the currently advertised price, referred to as the demand function. We analyze the problem of maximizing the average profit gained by admissions of SUs, when the demand function is unknown. We introduce a new on-line algorithm, called Measurement-based Threshold Pricing (MTP), that requires the optimization of only two parameters, a price and a threshold, whereby SU calls are admitted and charged a fixed price when the channel occupancy is lower than the threshold and rejected otherwise. At each iteration, MTP measures the average arrival rate of SUs corresponding to a certain test price. We prove that these measurements of the secondary demand are sufficient for MTP to converge to a local optimal price and corresponding optimal threshold, within a number of measurements that is logarithmic in the total number of possible prices. We further provide an adaptive version of MTP that adjusts to time-varying demand and establish its convergence properties. We conduct numerical studies showing the convergence of MTP to near-optimal online profit and its superior performance over a traditional reinforcement learning approach.},

abstract={Managing the power resource in battery operated wireless devices is very crucial for extending the lifetime, here we propose the concept of power trading in wireless communications. We present a business model using sealed bid procurement auction based game theory for power-trading in cooperative wireless communication with quality of service (QoS) constraints. We formulate the problem as an auction in a buyer's market sequentially/repeatedly played with a single source and a multiple relay network. The source, in-need of cooperation of a relay due to lack of battery power to communicate with the destination, broadcasts a cooperation-request specifying its QoS requirements. The QoS that we consider here are the bit error rate and the total delay associated with relaying the source data. The relays respond with their bids in terms of Euros/bit, and the source selects the best relay based on the bids. The relays compete with each other to win the game and profit from power trading. Each relay updates its pricing index via reinforcement learning to win the game during successive bidding intervals of the repeated game. Based on this model our results show that the relay node with the best features such as a better wireless channel and a better geographical position with respect to the source and destination nodes has a better chance of winning the game, and hence giving rise to a dominant strategy. More importantly, we show that the gains from the wireless channels can be converted into economic profits which is an attractive feature of the proposed business model for power trading.},

abstract={Dynamic spectrum leasing (DSL) was proposed recently as a new paradigm for dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) in cognitive radio networks (CRN's). In this paper, we propose a new way to encourage primary users to lease their spectrum: The secondary users (SU's) place bids indicating how much power they are willing to spend for relaying the primary signals to their destinations. In this formulation, the primary users achieve power savings due to asymmetric cooperation. We propose and analyze both a centralized and a distributed decision-making architecture for the secondary CRN. In the centralized architecture, a Secondary System Decision Center (SSDC) selects a bid for each primary channel based on optimal channel assignment for SU's. In the decentralized cognitive network architecture, we formulate an auction game-based protocol in which each SU independently places bids for each primary channel and receivers of each primary link pick the bid that will lead to the most power savings. A simple and robust distributed reinforcement learning mechanism is developed to allow the users to revise their bids and to increase their rewards. The performance results show the significant impact of reinforcement learning in both improving spectrum utilization and meeting individual SU performance requirements.},

abstract={This paper deals with the problem of aggregated interference generated by multiple cognitive radios (CRs) at the receivers of primary (licensed) users. In particular, we consider a secondary CR system based on the IEEE 802.22 standard for wireless regional area networks (WRANs), and we model it as a multiagent system where the multiple agents are the different secondary base stations in charge of controlling the secondary cells. We propose a form of real-time multiagent reinforcement learning, which is known as decentralized Q-learning, to manage the aggregated interference generated by multiple WRAN systems. We consider both situations of complete and partial information about the environment. By directly interacting with the surrounding environment in a distributed fashion, the multiagent system is able to learn, in the first case, an efficient policy to solve the problem and, in the second case, a reasonably good suboptimal policy. Computational and memory requirement considerations are also presented, discussing two different options for uploading and processing the learning information. Simulation results, which are presented for both the upstream and downstream cases, reveal that the proposed approach is able to fulfill the primary-user interference constraints, without introducing signaling overhead in the system.},

abstract={Next-generation wireless networks will integrate multiple wireless access technologies to provide seamless mobility to mobile users with high-speed wireless connectivity. This will give rise to a heterogeneous wireless access environment where network selection becomes crucial for load balancing to avoid network congestion and performance degradation. We study the dynamics of network selection in a heterogeneous wireless network using the theory of evolutionary games. The competition among groups of users in different service areas to share the limited amount of bandwidth in the available wireless access networks is formulated as a dynamic evolutionary game, and the evolutionary equilibrium is considered to be the solution to this game. We present two algorithms, namely, population evolution and reinforcement-learning algorithms for network selection. Although the network-selection algorithm based on population evolution can reach the evolutionary equilibrium faster, it requires a centralized controller to gather, process, and broadcast information about the users in the corresponding service area. In contrast, with reinforcement learning, a user can gradually learn (by interacting with the service provider) and adapt the decision on network selection to reach evolutionary equilibrium without any interaction with other users. Performance of the dynamic evolutionary game-based network-selection algorithms is empirically investigated. The accuracy of the numerical results obtained from the game model is evaluated by using simulations.},

pages={1789-1805}, 
abstract={In this paper, an innovative mechanism to perform joint radio resource management (JRRM) in the context of heterogeneous radio access networks is introduced. In particular, a fuzzy neural algorithm that is able to ensure certain quality-of-service (QoS) constraints in a multicell scenario deployment with three different radio access technologies (RATs), namely, the wireless local area network (WLAN), the universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS), and the global system for mobile communications (GSM)/Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) radio access network (GERAN), is discussed. The proposed fuzzy neural JRRM algorithm is able to jointly manage the common available radio resources operating in two steps. The first step selects a suitable combination of cells built around the three available RATs, while the second step chooses the most appropriate RAT to which a user should be attached. A proper granted bit rate is also selected for each user in the second step. Different implementations are presented and compared, showing that the envisaged fuzzy neural methodology framework, which is able to cope with the complexities and uncertainties of heterogeneous scenarios, could be a promising choice. Furthermore, simulation results show that the reinforcement learning mechanisms introduced in the proposed JRRM methodology allow guaranteeing the QoS requirement in terms of the so-called user dissatisfaction probability in the presence of different traffic loads and under different dynamic situations. Also, the proposed framework is able to take into consideration different operator policies as well as different subjective criteria by means of a multiple decision-making mechanism, such as balancing the traffic among the RATs or giving more priority to the selection of one RAT in front of another one.},

year={2007}, 
volume={25}, 
number={6}, 
pages={1101-1112}, 
abstract={One of the distinctive features in a wireless ad hoc network is lack of any central controller or single point of authority, in which each node/link then makes its own decisions independently. Therefore, fully cooperative behaviors, such as cooperation for increasing system capacity, mitigating interference for each other, or honestly revealing private information, might not be directly applied. It has been shown that power control is an efficient approach to achieve quality of service (QoS) requirement in ad hoc networks. However, the existing work has largely relied on cooperation among different nodes/links or a pricing mechanism that often needs a third-party involvement. In this paper, we aim to design a non-cooperative power control algorithm without pricing mechanism for ad hoc networks. We view the interaction among the users' decision for power level as a repeated game. With the theory of stochastic fictitious play (SFP), we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm to schedule each user's power level. There are three distinctive features in our proposed scheme. First, the user's decision at each stage is self-incentive with myopic best response correspondence. Second, the dynamics arising from our proposed algorithm eventually converges to pure Nash equilibrium (NE). Third, our scheme does not need any information exchange or to observe the opponents' private information. Therefore, this proposed algorithm can safely run in a fully selfish environment without any additional pricing and secure mechanism. Simulation study demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.},

abstract={An efficient channel allocation policy that prioritizes handoffs is an indispensable ingredient in future cellular networks in order to support multimedia traffic while ensuring quality of service requirements (QoS). In this paper we study the application of a reinforcement-learning algorithm to develop an alternative channel allocation scheme in mobile cellular networks that supports multiple heterogeneous traffic classes. The proposed scheme prioritizes handoff call requests over new calls and provides differentiated services for different traffic classes with diverse characteristics and quality of service requirements. Furthermore, it is asymptotically optimal, computationally inexpensive, model-free, and can adapt to changing traffic conditions. Simulations are provided to compare the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with other known resource-sharing policies such as complete sharing and reservation policies},

abstract={To balance the time-varying traffic load between cells, caused by user mobility and diverse applications, it is crucial for next-generation code-division multiple-access (CDMA) cellular networks to configure cell coverage and capacity dynamically.

pages={38-48}, 
abstract={In this paper, a Q-learning-based multirate transmission control (Q-MRTC) scheme for radio resource management in multimedia wide-band code-division multiple access (WCDMA) communication systems is proposed. The multirate transmission control problem is modeled as a Markov decision process where the transmission cost is defined in terms of the quality-of-service (QoS) parameters for enhancing spectrum utilization subject to QoS constraint. We adopt a real-time reinforcement learning algorithm, called Q-learning, to accurately estimate the transmission cost for the MRTC. In the meantime, we successfully employ the feature extraction method and radial basis function network (RBFN) for the Q-function that maps the original state space into a feature vector that represents the resultant interference profile. The state space and memory-storage requirement are then reduced and the convergence property of the Q-learning algorithm is improved. Simulation results show that the Q-MRTC for a multimedia WCDMA system can achieve higher system throughput by an amount of 80% and better users' satisfaction than the interference-based MRTC scheme, while the QoS requirements are guaranteed. Also, compared to the table-lookup method, the storage requirement is reduced by 41%.},

pages={542-552}, 
abstract={This paper investigates the application of linear reinforcement learning stochastic approximation to the blind adaptive energy estimation for a decorrelating decision-feedback (DDF) multiuser detector over synchronous code-division multiple-access (CDMA) radio channels in the presence of multiple-access interference (MAI) and additive Gaussian noise. The decision-feedback incorporated into the structure of a linear decorrelating detector is able to significantly improve the weaker users' performance by cancelling the MAI from the stronger users. However, the DDF receiver requires the knowledge of the received energies. In this paper, a new novel blind estimation mechanism is proposed to estimate all the users' energies using a stochastic approximation algorithm without training data. In order to increase the convergence speed of the energy estimation, a linear reinforcement learning technique is conducted to accelerate the stochastic approximation algorithms. Results show that our blind adaptation mechanism is able to accurately estimate all the users' energies even if the users of the DDF detector are not ranked properly. After performing the blind energy estimation and then reordering the users in a nonincreasing order, numerical simulations show that the DDF detector for the weakest user performs closely to the maximum likelihood detector, whose complexity grows exponentially with the number of users},

title={Secure D2D Communication in Large-Scale Cognitive Cellular Networks: A Wireless Power Transfer Model},
year={2016},
volume={64},
number={1},
pages={329-342},
abstract={In this paper, we investigate secure device-to-device (D2D) communication in energy harvesting large-scale cognitive cellular networks. The energy constrained D2D transmitter harvests energy from multiantenna equipped power beacons (PBs), and communicates with the corresponding receiver using the spectrum of the primary base stations (BSs). We introduce a power transfer model and an information signal model to enable wireless energy harvesting and secure information transmission. In the power transfer model, three wireless power transfer (WPT) policies are proposed: 1) co-operative power beacons (CPB) power transfer, 2) best power beacon (BPB) power transfer, and 3) nearest power beacon (NPB) power transfer. To characterize the power transfer reliability of the proposed three policies, we derive new expressions for the exact power outage probability. Moreover, the analysis of the power outage probability is extended to the case when PBs are equipped with large antenna arrays. In the information signal model, we present a new comparative framework with two receiver selection schemes: 1) best receiver selection (BRS), where the receiver with the strongest channel is selected; and 2) nearest receiver selection (NRS), where the nearest receiver is selected. To assess the secrecy performance, we derive new analytical expressions for the secrecy outage probability and the secrecy throughput considering the two receiver selection schemes using the proposed WPT policies. We presented Monte carlo simulation results to corroborate our analysis and show: 1) secrecy performance improves with increasing densities of PBs and D2D receivers due to larger multiuser diversity gain; 2) CPB achieves better secrecy performance than BPB and NPB but consumes more power; and 3) BRS achieves better secrecy performance than NRS but demands more instantaneous feedback and overhead. A pivotal conclusion is reached that with increasing number of antennas at - Bs, NPB offers a comparable secrecy performance to that of BPB but with a lower complexity.},

abstract={As the latest member of the multiple access family, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been recently proposed for 3GPP LTE and is envisioned to be an essential component of 5G mobile networks. The key feature of NOMA is to serve multiple users at the same time/frequency/ code, but with different power levels, which yields a significant spectral efficiency gain over conventional orthogonal MA. The article provides a systematic treatment of this newly emerging technology, from its combination with MIMO technologies to cooperative NOMA, as well as the interplay between NOMA and cognitive radio.

abstract={In this paper, we present a novel hybrid framework combining compressive spectrum sensing with geo-location database to find spectrum holes in a decentralized cognitive radio. In the hybrid framework, a geo-location database algorithm is proposed to be stored locally at secondary users (SUs) to remove the extra transmission link to a centralized remote geo-location database. Specifically, by utilizing the output of the locally stored geo-location database algorithm, a data-assisted noniteratively reweighted least squares (DNRLS)-based compressive spectrum sensing algorithm is proposed to improve detection performance under sub-Nyquist sampling rates for wideband spectrum sensing, and to reduce the computational complexity of signal recovery. In addition, an efficient method for the calculation of maximum allowable equivalent isotropic radiated power in TV white space (TVWS) is also designed to further support SUs. The convergence and complexity of the proposed DNRLS algorithm are analyzed theoretically. Furthermore, the proposed framework is pioneered on real-time “from air” signals and data after having been validated by simulated signals and data in TVWS.},

pages={3143-3156},
abstract={Wireless sensor networks operating in the license-free spectrum suffer from uncontrolled interference as those spectrum bands become increasingly crowded. The emerging cognitive radio sensor networks (CRSNs) provide a promising solution to address this challenge by enabling sensor nodes to opportunistically access licensed channels. However, since sensor nodes have to consume considerable energy to support CR functionalities, such as channel sensing and switching, the opportunistic channel accessing should be carefully devised for improving the energy efficiency in CRSN. To this end, we investigate the dynamic channel accessing problem to improve the energy efficiency for a clustered CRSN. Under the primary users' protection requirement, we study the resource allocation issues to maximize the energy efficiency of utilizing a licensed channel for intra-cluster and inter-cluster data transmission, respectively. Moreover, with the consideration of the energy consumption in channel sensing and switching, we further determine the condition when sensor nodes should sense and switch to a licensed channel for improving the energy efficiency, according to the packet loss rate of the license-free channel. In addition, two dynamic channel accessing schemes are proposed to identify the channel sensing and switching sequences for intra-cluster and inter-cluster data transmission, respectively. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed channel accessing schemes can significantly reduce the energy consumption in CRSNs.},

abstract={Wireless energy harvesting is regarded as a promising energy supply alternative for energy-constrained wireless networks. In this paper, a new wireless energy harvesting protocol is proposed for an underlay cognitive relay network with multiple primary user (PU) transceivers. In this protocol, the secondary nodes can harvest energy from the primary network (PN) while sharing the licensed spectrum of the PN. In order to assess the impact of different system parameters on the proposed network, we first derive an exact expression for the outage probability for the secondary network (SN) subject to three important power constraints: 1) the maximum transmit power at the secondary source (SS) and at the secondary relay (SR); 2) the peak interference power permitted at each PU receiver; and 3) the interference power from each PU transmitter to the SR and to the secondary destination (SD). To obtain practical design insights into the impact of different parameters on successful data transmission of the SN, we derive throughput expressions for both the delay-sensitive and the delay-tolerant transmission modes. We also derive asymptotic closed-form expressions for the outage probability and the delay-sensitive throughput and an asymptotic analytical expression for the delay-tolerant throughput as the number of PU transceivers goes to infinity. The results show that the outage probability improves when PU transmitters are located near SS and sufficiently far from SR and SD. Our results also show that when the number of PU transmitters is large, the detrimental effect of interference from PU transmitters outweighs the benefits of energy harvested from the PU transmitters.},

abstract={Green communications is an inevitable trend for future communication network design, especially for a cognitive radio network. Power allocation strategies are of crucial importance for green cognitive radio networks. However, energy-efficient power allocation strategies in green cognitive radio networks have not been fully studied. Energy efficiency maximization problems are analyzed in delay-insensitive cognitive radio, delay-sensitive cognitive radio, and simultaneously delay-insensitive and delay-sensitive cognitive radio, where a secondary user coexists with a primary user and the channels are fading. Using fractional programming and convex optimization techniques, energy-efficient optimal power allocation strategies are proposed subject to constraints on the average interference power, along with the peak/average transmit power. It is shown that the secondary user can achieve energy efficiency gains under the average transmit power constraint, in contrast to the peak transmit power constraint. Simulation results show that the fading of the channel between the primary user transmitter and the secondary user receiver and the fading of the channel between the secondary user transmitter and the primary user receiver are favorable to the secondary user with respect to the energy efficiency maximization of the secondary user, whereas the fading of the channel between the secondary user transmitter and the secondary user receiver is unfavorable to the secondary user.},

abstract={In this paper, we study a two-phase underlay cognitive relay network, where there exists an eavesdropper who can overhear the message. The secure data transmission from the secondary source to secondary destination is assisted by two decode-and-forward (DF) relays. Although the traditional opportunistic relaying technique can choose one relay to provide the best secure performance, it needs to continuously have the channel state information (CSI) of both relays, and may result in a high relay switching rate. To overcome these limitations, a secure switch-and-stay combining (SSSC) protocol is proposed where only one out of the two relays is activated to assist the secure data transmission, and the secure relay switching occurs when the relay cannot support the secure communication any longer. This security switching is assisted by either instantaneous or statistical eavesdropping CSI. For these two cases, we study the system secure performance of SSSC protocol, by deriving the analytical secrecy outage probability as well as an asymptotic expression for the high main-to-eavesdropper ratio (MER) region. We show that SSSC can substantially reduce the system complexity while achieving or approaching the full diversity order of opportunistic relaying in the presence of the instantaneous or statistical eavesdropping CSI.},

Different from the existing works, we investigate the power control and sensing time optimization problem in a cognitive small cell network, where the cross-tier interference mitigation, imperfect hybrid spectrum sensing, and energy efficiency are considered. The optimization of energy efficient sensing time and power allocation is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. We solve the proposed problem in an asymptotically optimal manner.

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of exploiting interference among simultaneous multiuser transmissions in the downlink of multiple-antenna systems. Using symbol-level precoding, a new approach toward addressing the multiuser interference is discussed through jointly utilizing the channel state information (CSI) and data information (DI). The interference among the data streams is transformed under certain conditions to a useful signal that can improve the signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR) of the downlink transmissions and as a result the system's energy efficiency. In this context, new constructive interference precoding techniques that tackle the transmit power minimization (min power) with individual SINR constraints at each user's receiver have been proposed. In this paper, we generalize the constructive interference (CI) precoding design under the assumption that the received MPSK symbol can reside in a relaxed region in order to be correctly detected. Moreover, a weighted maximization of the minimum SNR among all users is studied taking into account the relaxed detection region. Symbol error rate analysis (SER) for the proposed precoding is discussed to characterize the tradeoff between transmit power reduction and SER increase due to the relaxation. Based on this tradeoff, the energy efficiency performance of the proposed technique is analyzed. Finally, extensive numerical results show that the proposed schemes outperform other state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract={Interference field in wireless networks is often modeled by a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP). While it is realistic in modeling the inherent node irregularity and provides meaningful first-order results, it falls short in modeling the effect of interference management techniques, which typically introduces some form of spatial interaction among active transmitters. In some applications, such as cognitive radio and device-to-device networks, this interaction may result in the formation of holes in an otherwise homogeneous interference field. The resulting interference field can be accurately modeled as a Poisson hole process (PHP). Despite the importance of the PHP in many applications, the exact characterization of interference experienced by a typical node in the PHP is not known. In this paper, we derive several tight upper and lower bounds on the Laplace transform of this interference. Numerical comparisons reveal that the new bounds outperform all known bounds and approximations, and are remarkably tight in all operational regimes of interest. The key in deriving these tight and yet simple bounds is to capture the local neighborhood around the typical node accurately while simplifying the far field to attain tractability. Ideas for tightening these bounds further by incorporating the effect of overlaps in the holes are also discussed. These results immediately lead to an accurate characterization of the coverage probability of the typical node in the PHP under Rayleigh fading.},

abstract={In this paper, a wireless energy harvesting and information transfer protocol in cognitive relay networks is investigated, where an energy harvesting secondary network shares the spectrum as well as harvests energy by assisting the primary transmission. Specifically, a secondary transmitter scavenges energy from the received primary signal and then employs the harvested energy to forward the resulting signals along with the secondary signal. The secondary receiver can also harvest the ambient energy, and use the remaining signal to cancel the primary interference. We analytically derive the exact expressions of the outage probabilities for both primary and secondary networks. The rate-energy tradeoff between the ergodic capacity and harvested energy in the secondary network is also discussed. Furthermore, to quantify the energy consumption, we investigate the system energy efficiency. Moreover, we address the optimization power allocation strategy under three performance criteria and theoretically prove that the resulting nonconvex optimization problems can be converted into biconvex problems. The corresponding effective algorithms are then developed to solve the optimization problems. Numerical results show that the proposed protocol not only achieves both the primary and secondary transmissions but also harvests the ambient energy.},

abstract={We are in the midst of a major paradigm shift in how we manage radio spectrum. This paradigm shift is necessitated by the growth of wireless services of all types and the demand pressure imposed on limited spectrum resources under legacy management regimes. The shift is feasible because of advances in radio and networking technologies that make it possible to share spectrum dynamically in all possible dimensions-i.e., across frequencies, time, location, users, uses, and networks. Realizing the full potential of this shift to Dynamic Spectrum Sharing will require the co-evolution of wireless technologies, markets, and regulatory policies; a process which is occurring on a global scale. This paper provides a current overview of major technological and regulatory reforms that are leading the way toward a global paradigm shift to more flexible, dynamic, market-based ways to manage and share radio spectrum resources. We focus on current efforts to implement database-driven approaches for managing the shared co-existence of users with heterogeneous access and interference protection rights, and discuss open research challenges.},

title={Synergistic spectrum sharing in 5G HetNets: A harmonized SDN-enabled approach},
year={2016},
volume={54},
number={1},
pages={40-47},
abstract={Given the anticipated 1000 times growth of tele-traffic, the conception of efficient spectrum management and sharing mechanisms becomes essential for 5G networks due to the scarcity of spectral resources. To meet this ambitious goal, we propose an SDN-based synergistic spectrum sharing technique, the harmonized SDN-enabled approach (HSA), which relies on distributed input reporting on spectrum availabilities in 5G heterogeneous networks. Conventional spectrum sharing mechanisms, particularly those using cognitive radio techniques, rely heavily on spectrum sensing and adaptive transmission-aided communications devices. However, this device-level spectrum sharing might lead to inaccurate sharing decisions due to the widely fluctuating signal quality observed by each device. Moreover, the network becomes vulnerable to malicious devices that report false sensing data to gain unfair access to the spectrum. These problems are further compounded by the fact that operational cellular networks have a somewhat rigid architecture relying on vendor-specific configuration interfaces, hence restricting the operators to have, at best, only indirect control of the network's operation and resources. In addressing these challenges, we adopt a synergistic approach that integrates the distributed sensing devices, cellular base stations, and SDN controller into an intrinsically amalgamated network. To alleviate any potential controller scalability and latency concerns, HSA harmonizes the network's operation by distributing the local decision making and network-wide policy making tasks among the base stations and the SDN controller, respectively. The article outlines the detailed network architecture and also presents an efficient resource management algorithm.},

year={2016},
volume={15},

pages={3690-3702},
abstract={Secondary access to the licensed spectrum is viable only if the interference is avoided at the primary system. In this regard, different paradigms have been conceptualized in the existing literature. Among these, interweave systems (ISs) that employ spectrum sensing have been widely investigated. Baseline models investigated in the literature characterize the performance of the IS in terms of a sensing-throughput tradeoff, however, this characterization assumes perfect knowledge of the involved channels at the secondary transmitter, which is unavailable in practice. Motivated by this fact, we establish a novel approach that incorporates channel estimation in the system model, and consequently investigate the impact of imperfect channel knowledge on the performance of the IS. More particularly, the variation induced in the detection probability affects the detector's performance at the secondary transmitter, which may result in severe interference at the primary receivers. In this view, we propose employing average and outage constraints on the detection probability, in order to capture the performance of the IS. Our analysis reveals that with an appropriate choice of the estimation time determined by the proposed approach, the performance degradation of the IS can be effectively controlled, and subsequently the achievable secondary throughput can be significantly enhanced.},

abstract={Ultra-densification is one of the main features of 5G networks. In an ultra-dense network, how to conduct interference management and spectrum allocation is a challenging issue. Spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks is a distributed and efficient way to resolve this issue in ultra-dense networks. However, most of the studies on spectrum sensing only focus on sensing temporal spectrum opportunities where one or multiple primary users are active, which does not make full use of spectrum opportunities in the spatial location domain. To overcome the shortcomings of conventional temporal spectrum sensing, we study the problem of spatial spectrum sensing, which senses spatial spectrum opportunities in wireless networks. In this paper, the performance of spatial spectrum sensing and its application in sensing-based device-to-device (D2D) cellular networks are analyzed using stochastic geometry. Specifically, by modeling the locations of active transmitters as a Poisson point process, the spatial spectrum sensing problem is formulated using the framework of a detection theory. Closed-form expressions are obtained for the sensing threshold, probabilities of spatial detection, and false alarm. Furthermore, analytical throughput for D2D users and cellular users under both channel inversion and constant power allocation cases are derived. The optimal sensing radius that maximizes the defined network metric is obtained numerically. Finally, the simulation and numerical results are presented to verify our theoretical analysis.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is a world wide network of interconnected objects. IoT capable objects will be interconnected through wired and wireless communication technologies. However, cost-effectiveness issues and accessibility to remote users make wireless communication as a feasible solution. A majority of possibilities have been proposed but many of these suffer from vulnerabilities to dynamic environmental conditions, ease of access, bandwidth allocation and utilization, and cost to purchase spectrum. Thus trends are shifting to the adaptability of Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) into IoT. Additionally, ubiquitous objects with cognitive capabilities will be able to make intelligent decisions to achieve interference-free and on-demand services. The main goal of this paper is to discuss how CR technology can be helpful for the IoT paradigm.

abstract={We integrate a wireless powered communication network with a cooperative cognitive radio network, where multiple secondary users (SUs) powered wirelessly by a hybrid access point (HAP) help a primary user relay the data. As a reward for the cooperation, the secondary network gains the spectrum access where SUs transmit to HAP using time division multiple access. To maximize the sum throughput of SUs, we present a secondary sum-throughput optimal resource allocation (STORA) scheme. Under the constraint of meeting target primary rate, the STORA scheme chooses the optimal set of relaying SUs and jointly performs the time and energy allocation for SUs. In particular, by exploiting the structure of the optimal solution, we find the order in which SUs are prioritized to relay primary data. Since the STORA scheme focuses on the sum throughput, it becomes inconsiderate toward individual SU throughput, resulting in low fairness. To enhance fairness, we investigate three resource allocation schemes, which are: 1) equal time allocation; 2) minimum throughput maximization; and 3) proportional time allocation. Simulation results reveal the tradeoff between sum throughput and fairness. The minimum throughput maximization scheme is the fairest one as each SU gets the same throughput, but yields the least SU sum throughput.},

abstract={Spectrum sharing and energy harvesting are promising techniques to improve the bandwidth and energy efficiencies to meet the ever-growing demand of wireless data transmissions. In this paper, we propose an efficient relay-based spectrum sharing protocol in the cognitive radio network, where the secondary user (SU) can implicitly harvest the radio frequency (RF) energy from the primary user (PU) transmissions. Using the harvested energy, the SU can assist the PU transmission to exchange for the opportunity of spectrum access. Both the Alamouti coding and the superposition coding techniques are adopted by the transmitters to facilitate the primary data relaying and the secondary data transmission simultaneously. The joint decoding and the interference cancelation techniques are adopted by the receivers to retrieve the desired signals. The more power allocated for the primary data relaying, the higher throughput can be achieved for the PU, while the less throughput is available for the SU with less energy remained. The optimal power allocation is numerically determined by maximizing the SU throughput while guaranteeing the PU throughput. Numerical results show that our protocol can greatly improve the system throughput and the impacts of various system settings are revealed for the network deployment.},

The proposed method estimates attack strength and applies it in the k-out-N rule to obtain the optimum value of k that minimizes the Bayes risk.

We consider the opportunistic use of the idle spectrum, unused by primary users (PUs), through a mechanism of two-step opportunistic spectrum access for the SUs, consisting of random channel sensing followed by random channel access. Unlike the majority of previous studies, which have considered CR networks with energy harvesting under a single user setting, the goal of this paper is to investigate the joint impact of sensing probability, access probability, and energy queue capacity on the maximum achievable throughput in a multiuser CR network incorporating energy harvesting. For two extreme cases, those where the energy queue capacity is either infinite or extremely small, we show that the maximum achievable throughput is not affected by the channel access probability if the channel sensing probability is chosen appropriately and the optimal sensing probability is derived as a function of network parameters such as the energy arrival rate, channel availability probability, and number of contending SUs.},

abstract={Increasing spectrum-efficiency (SE) as well as energy-efficiency (EE) has attracted much attention recently due to the fact that the future wireless networks need to address the issues of high throughput and low power consumption. However, the objective for optimizing SE sometimes conflicts with the one for optimizing EE, and the methods for improving EE may result in a decrease in SE. In this paper, we consider the SE-EE tradeoff for cognitive radio (CR) networks with co-operative spectrum sensing (CSS). First, we formulate the general problem, and analyze two special cases: the SE maximization problem and the EE maximization problem. The SE and EE are optimized separately via joint optimization of sensing duration and final decision threshold in CSS. Based on the solutions of the two special cases, the general problem for SE-EE tradeoff is solved. Then, we consider the tradeoff of SE and EE from two perspectives: (1) maximizing EE while satisfying SE requirement; and (2) maximizing SE while satisfying EE requirement. Efficient algorithms for sensing strategy design are proposed for each scenario. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sensing strategies and illustrate the tradeoff between SE and EE via simulations.},

abstract={There is a growing need for government agencies to monitor suspicious communication links to prevent crimes and terror attacks. In this paper, we study a legitimate surveillance scenario where a legitimate monitor aims to intercept the suspicious communication between a transmitter and a receiver over fading channels. The legitimate monitor can eavesdrop (decode) the information of the suspicious link only when its achievable data rate is no smaller than that at the suspicious receiver. In practice, the legitimate eavesdropping is challenging, especially when the legitimate monitor is far from the suspicious transmitter. To overcome this issue, we propose a new approach, namely proactive eavesdropping via cognitive jamming, in which the legitimate monitor purposely jams the receiver and changes the suspicious communication (e.g., to a smaller data rate) in order to overhear easily. In particular, we consider delay-sensitive and delay-insensitive applications for the suspicious transmission, under which the legitimate monitor maximizes the eavesdropping non-outage probability and the relative eavesdropping rate, respectively, by optimizing its jamming power allocation over different fading states subject to an average power constraint. We present efficient algorithms for optimally solving the formulated problems. Numerical results show that thanks to the cognitive jamming, the proposed proactive eavesdropping scheme greatly outperforms the conventional passive eavesdropping without jamming.},

abstract={Direct-conversion radio (DCR) receivers can offer highly integrated low-cost hardware solutions for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio (CR) systems. However, the DCR receivers are susceptible to radio frequency (RF) impairments, such as in-phase and quadrature-phase imbalance, low-noise amplifier nonlinearities, and phase noise, which limit the spectrum sensing capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the joint effects of RF impairments on energy detection-based spectrum sensing for CR systems in multi-channel environments. In particular, we provide the novel closed-form expressions for the evaluation of the detection and false alarm probabilities, assuming Rayleigh fading. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to the case of CR networks with cooperative sensing, where the secondary users suffer from different levels of RF imperfections, considering both scenarios of error free and imperfect reporting channel. Numerical and simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of the analysis as well as the detrimental effects of RF imperfections on the spectrum sensing performance, which bring significant losses in the spectrum utilization.},

abstract={In this letter, we study the problem of secrecy wireless information and power transfer in a cognitive relay network (CRN), where a secondary transmitter (ST) aids the signal transmission from a primary transmitter to a primary receiver (PR), while it also transmits its own signal to a second receiver (SR). Both the PR and SR decode information and harvest energy from the received signals based on a power splitting strategy. Due to the open architecture of a CRN, the information for SR is prone to be eavesdropped by PR. This letter aims to minimize the transmit power at ST while guaranteeing minimum information rates and the amounts of harvested energy at PR and SR, and constraining the potential eavesdropping rate at PR. Considering imperfect channel state information at ST, we propose a joint robust beamforming and transformation matrix at ST and power splitting at the PR and SR schemes, which can minimize the transmit power in the worst case. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

abstract={Cooperation among cognitive radios for spectrum sensing is deemed essential for environments with deep shadows. In this paper, we study cooperative spectrum sensing for cognitive radio ad hoc networks where there is no fusion center to aggregate the information from various secondary users. We propose a novel consensus-inspired cooperative sensing scheme based on linear iterations that is fully distributed and low-cost. In addition, the tradeoffs on the number of consensus iterations are explored for scenarios with different shadow fading characteristics. Furthermore, we model insistent spectrum sensing data falsification (ISSDF) attack aimed at consensus-based iterative schemes and show its destructive effect on the cooperation performance which accordingly results in reduced spectrum efficiency and increased interference with primary users. We propose a trust management scheme to mitigate these attacks and evaluate the performance improvement through extensive Monte Carlo simulations for large-scale cognitive radio ad hoc networks in TV white space. Our proposed trust management reduces the harm of a set of collusive ISSDF attackers up to two orders of magnitude in terms of missed-detection and false alarm error rates. Moreover, in a hostile environment, integration of trust management into cooperative schemes considerably relaxes the sensitivity requirements on the cognitive radio devices.},

abstract={This paper studies carrier aggregation between multiple mobile network operators (MNOs), referred to as interoperator carrier aggregation (IO-CA). In IO-CA, each MNO can transmit on its own licensed spectrum and aggregate the spectrum licensed to other MNOs. We focus on the case that MNOs are partitioned and distributed into small groups, called IO-CA pairs, each of which consists of two MNOs that mutually agree to share their spectrum with each other. We model the IO-CA pairing problem between MNOs as a stable roommate market and derive a condition for which a stable matching structure among all MNOs exist. We propose an algorithm that achieves a stable matching if it exists. Otherwise, the algorithm results in a stable partition. For each IO-CA pair, we derive the optimal transmit power for each spectrum aggregator and establish a Stackelberg game model to analyze the interaction between the licensed subscribers and aggregators in the spectrum of each MNO. We derive the Stackelberg equilibrium of our proposed game and then develop a joint optimization algorithm that achieves the stable matching structure among MNOs as well as the optimal transmit powers for the aggregators and prices for the subscribers of each MNO.},

abstract={Can an intelligent jammer learn and adapt to unknown environments in an electronic warfare-type scenario? In this paper, we answer this question in the positive, by developing a cognitive jammer that adaptively and optimally disrupts the communication between a victim transmitter-receiver pair. We formalize the problem using a multiarmed bandit framework where the jammer can choose various physical layer parameters such as the signaling scheme, power level and the on-off/pulsing duration in an attempt to obtain power efficient jamming strategies. We first present online learning algorithms to maximize the jamming efficacy against static transmitter-receiver pairs and prove that these algorithms converge to the optimal (in terms of the error rate inflicted at the victim and the energy used) jamming strategy. Even more importantly, we prove that the rate of convergence to the optimal jamming strategy is sublinear, i.e., the learning is fast in comparison to existing reinforcement learning algorithms, which is particularly important in dynamically changing wireless environments. Also, we characterize the performance of the proposed bandit-based learning algorithm against multiple static and adaptive transmitter-receiver pairs.},

abstract={In this letter, we consider an RF-powered green cognitive radio network (RF-GCRN), where a central node, called a power beacon (PB), harvests green energy from ambient sources and wirelessly delivers random harvested energy to cognitive users. Random in-band energy transmission by PB is the only energy source of cognitive users. Performance of this network, with a single pair of secondary users, is analyzed under two spectrum access schemes, i.e., random access and spectrum sensing-based access schemes. Results show feasibility of the RF-GCRN model, if the energy transmission rate is below a certain threshold. This threshold is determined according to maximum tolerable delay of primary user and parameters of spectrum access scheme. Finding a closed form expression for this threshold results in a quite complicated formula, which cannot be helpful in determining feasibility region, due to excessive complexity. Instead, we numerically calculated feasibility regions of both access schemes to facilitate parameter selection process.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the achievable energy efficiency of cognitive radio networks where two main modes are of interest, namely, spectrum sharing (known as underlay paradigm) and spectrum sensing (or interweave paradigm). In order to improve the energy efficiency, we formulate a new multiobjective optimization problem that jointly maximizes the ergodic capacity and minimizes the average transmission power of the secondary user network while limiting the average interference power imposed on the primary user receiver. The multiobjective optimization will be solved by first transferring it into a single objective problem (SOP), namely, a power minimization problem, by using the ε-constraint method. The formulated SOP will be solved using two different methods. Specifically, the minimum power allocation at the secondary transmitter in a spectrum sharing fading environment are obtained using the iterative search-based solution and augmented Lagrangian approach for single and multiple secondary links, respectively. The significance of having extra side information and also imperfect side information of cross channels at the secondary transmitter are investigated. The minimum power allocations under perfect and imperfect sensing schemes in interweave cognitive radio networks are also found. Our numerical results provide guidelines for the design of future cognitive radio networks.},

abstract={In TV White Space, the unlicensed users are required to periodically access a database to acquire information on the spectrum usage of the licensed users. In addition, the unlicensed users can access the database on-demand, whenever they believe convenient, to update the spectrum availability information. In this paper, we design the optimal database access strategy, i.e., the strategy allowing the unlicensed users to jointly: (1) maximize the expected overall communication opportunities through on-demand accesses; and (2) respect the regulatory specifications. To this aim, we develop a stochastic analytical framework that allows us to account for: (1) the PU activity dynamics; (2) the quality dynamics among the different channels; and (3) the overhead induced by the database access. Specifically, at first, we prove that the database access problem can be modeled as a Markov decision process, and we show that it cannot be solved through brute-force search. Then, we prove that the optimal strategy exhibits a threshold structure, and we exploit this threshold property to design an algorithm able to efficiently compute the optimal strategy. The analytical results are finally validated through simulations.},

abstract={A multiple-input single-output cognitive radio downlink network is studied with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer. In this network, a secondary user coexists with multiple primary users and multiple energy harvesting receivers. In order to guarantee secure communication and energy harvesting, the problem of robust secure artificial noise-aided beamforming and power splitting design is investigated under imperfect channel state information (CSI). Specifically, the transmit power minimization problem and the max-min fairness energy harvesting problem are formulated for both the bounded CSI error model and the probabilistic CSI error model. These problems are non-convex and challenging to solve. A 1-D search algorithm is proposed to solve these problems based on S-Procedure under the bounded CSI error model and based on Bernstein-type inequalities under the probabilistic CSI error model. It is shown that the optimal robust secure beamforming can be achieved under the bounded CSI error model, whereas a suboptimal beamforming solution can be obtained under the probabilistic CSI error model. A tradeoff is elucidated between the secrecy rate of the secondary user receiver and the energy harvested by the energy harvesting receivers under a max-min fairness criterion.},

The efficient coexistence of LTE-A and WiFi in the unlicensed spectrum bands requires advanced intelligent techniques. This paper first investigates the concept of LAA, which consists of four main functionalities: 1) carrier selection (CS); 2) listen-before-talk; 3) discontinuous transmission (DTX); and 4) transmit power control (TPC). Second, the LAA functionality implementation is provided using an open source LTE-A downlink link level simulator. Third, we devise an enhanced learning technique for CS and DTX for efficient coexistence among LTE-A and WiFi users. In particular, we provide a Q-learning mechanism for the advanced learning of the unlicensed band activity resulting in the efficient coexistence. Finally, we enhance the coexistence further through a double Q-learning method as a proposal for CS that takes into account both DTX and TPC improving both LTE and WiFi performance.

abstract={Cognitive radio (CR) is proposed to use the spectrum opportunistically. Spectrum opportunity (SOP) can be defined as the possibility of a spectrum-aware communication between a CR transmitter and a CR receiver. Successful spectrum-aware communication between the communicating CRs, which is utilization of SOP (USOP), depends on the SOP detection and the correct transmission of a packet. Spectrum sensing performance, physical channel, and network parameters affect the probability of USOP. In this letter, we characterize the probability of the USOP under different network topologies. The network topology is due to the relation between transmission ranges of licensed users and CRs. We numerically study this probability for different network parameters and topologies. We find that the characteristics of USOP highly depend on the network topology, CR sensing performance and licensed users' activities.},

We assume that the direct link between the primary transmitter and receiver is not available, i.e. broken, and that the CR transmitter assists the primary network as a relay to amplify-and-forward the transmitted symbols of the primary. SM is used in the secondary to split the transmission space into two amplitude-phase modulation (APM) and spatial domains. In the proposed scheme, the secondary transmitter retransmits the primary symbols in APM domain, while its own information is transmitted by the index of transmitting antenna, similar to space shift keying, without causing any interference to the primary receiver. We analyze the performance of the optimal detectors at both the primary and secondary receivers for the case of phase shift keying modulation in terms of the average symbol error rate (ASER). We also study the asymptotic behavior of the ASER at both the primary and secondary at high signal-to-noise ratios. Simulation results show that the SM can be effectively used in overlay CR systems.},

abstract={We propose cyclic prefix single carrier full-duplex transmission in amplify-and-forward cooperative spectrum sharing networks to achieve multipath diversity and full-duplex spectral efficiency. Integrating full-duplex transmission into cooperative spectrum sharing systems results in two intrinsic problems: 1) the residual loop interference occurs between the transmit and the receive antennas at the secondary relays and 2) the primary users simultaneously suffer interference from the secondary source (SS) and the secondary relays (SRs). Thus, examining the effects of residual loop interference under peak interference power constraint at the primary users and maximum transmit power constraints at the SS and the SRs is a particularly challenging problem in frequency selective fading channels. To do so, we derive and quantitatively compare the lower bounds on the outage probability and the corresponding asymptotic outage probability for max-min relay selection, partial relay selection, and maximum interference relay selection policies in frequency selective fading channels. To facilitate comparison, we provide the corresponding analysis for half-duplex. Our results show two complementary regions, named as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) dominant region and the residual loop interference dominant region, where the multipath diversity and spatial diversity can be achievable only in the SNR dominant region, however the diversity gain collapses to zero in the residual loop interference dominant region.},

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of precoder design that maximizes the throughput of a secondary user (SU) in an underlay multiple-input multiple-output cognitive radio network, where the channel state information (CSI) from the SU to the primary user (PU) is unavailable or inaccurate. The design maintains the quality of service for the PU through an interference amount measure in terms of the interference temperature or the leakage rate. For the case of unknown CSI, we propose an iterative adaptation algorithm by exploiting the side information in the primary communication network. For the case of imperfect CSI, we model the amount of uncertainty to be within a convex set defined by the Schatten norm and apply the maximin optimization to obtain the solution. To complete this paper, we derive the conditions on the CSI uncertainty radius under which the robust design with imperfect CSI would not perform better than the one with unknown CSI, when using the interference temperature metric. The proposed techniques are supported by numerical simulations.},

abstract={Next generation cellular systems are expected to entail a wide variety of wireless coverage zones, with cells of different sizes and capacities that can overlap in space and share the transmission resources. In this scenario, which is referred to as Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets), a fundamental challenge is the management of the handover process between macro, femto and pico cells. To limit the number of handovers and the signaling between the cells, it will hence be crucial to manage the user's mobility considering the context parameters, such as cells size, traffic loads, and user velocity. In this paper, we propose a theoretical model to characterize the performance of a mobile user in a HetNet scenario as a function of the user's mobility, the power profile of the neighboring cells, the handover parameters, and the traffic load of the different cells. We propose a Markov-based framework to model the handover process for the mobile user, and derive an optimal context-dependent handover criterion. The mathematical model is validated by means of simulations, comparing the performance of our strategy with conventional handover optimization techniques in different scenarios. Finally, we show the impact of the handover regulation on the users performance and how it is possible to improve the users capacity exploiting context information.},

title={On Characterization of Feasible Interference Regions in Cognitive Radio Networks},
year={2016},
volume={64},
number={2},
pages={511-524},
abstract={In an underlay cognitive radio network (CRN), in order to guarantee that all primary users (PUs) achieve their target-signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (target-SINRs), the interference caused by all secondary users (SUs) to the primary receiving-points should be controlled. To do so, the feasible cognitive interference region (FCIR), i.e., the region for allowable values of interference at all of the primary receiving-points, which guarantee the protection of the PUs, needs to be formally characterized. In the state-of-the-art interference management schemes for underlay CRNs, it is considered that all PUs are protected if the cognitive interference for each primary receiving-point is lower than a maximum threshold, the so called interference temperature limit (ITL) for the corresponding receiving-point. This is assumed to be fixed and independent of ITL values for other primary receiving-points, which corresponds to a box-like FCIR. In this paper, we characterize the FCIR for uplink transmissions in cellular CRNs and for direct transmissions in ad-hoc CRNs. We show that the FCIR is in fact a polyhedron (i.e., the maximum feasible cognitive interference threshold for each primary receiving-point is not a constant, and it depends on that for the other primary receiving-points). Therefore, in practical interference management algorithms, it is not proper to consider a constant and independent ITL value for each of the primary receiving-points. This finding would significantly affect the design of practical interference management schemes for CRNs. To demonstrate this, based on the characterized FCIR, we propose two power control algorithms to find the maximum number of admitted SUs and the maximum aggregate throughput of the SUs in infeasible and feasible CRNs, respectively. For two distinct objectives, our proposed interference management schemes outperform the existing ones. The numerical results also demonstrate how the assumption of fixed ITL values leads - o poor performance measures in CRNs.},

abstract={We tackle the challenging problem of streaming multiuser videos over the downlink of a cellular cognitive radio network (CRN), where each cognitive user (CU) can sense and access multiple channels at a time. Spectrum sensing, channel assignment, and power allocation strategies are jointly optimized to maximize the quality of service (QoS) for the CUs. We show that the formulated mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem can be decomposed into two subproblems: 1) SP1 for the optimal spectrum sensing strategy and 2) SP2 for the optimal channel assignment and power allocation, without sacrificing optimality. We show that SP1 can be optimally solved if there is no restriction on the sensing capability for each CU, and develop a column generation (CG)-based algorithm to solve SP2 iteratively in a distributed manner. We also develop a heuristic algorithm for spectrum sensing with greatly reduced requirement on CU hardware, while still achieving a highly competitive sensing performance. We analyze the proposed algorithms with respect to complexity and time efficiency, and derive a performance upper bound. The proposed algorithms are validated with simulations.},

abstract={An approach for joint optimal design system parameters is considered for energy efficient cluster-based spectrum sensing in cognitive radio (CR) networks. The design problem is formulated and subjected to primary user protection constraints and spectrum utilization requirements. An iterative algorithm with low computational complexity is proposed to determine joint optimal sensing time, data transmission time, and the number of CR users that maximize energy efficiency of the system. The design criterion combines two design parameters, namely, sensing time and data transmission time, into one parameter in order to reduce the complexity.

abstract={This paper proposes energy and cross-layer aware resource allocation techniques that allow dynamic spectrum access (DSA) users, by means of learning algorithms, to locate and exploit unused spectrum opportunities effectively. Specifically, we design private objective functions for DSA users with multiple channel access and adaptive power allocation capabilities. We also propose simple two-phase heuristics for allocating spectrum and power resources among users. The proposed heuristics split the spectrum and power allocation problem into two subproblems, and solve each of them separately. The spectrum allocation problem is solved, during the first phase using learning. Two procedures to learn the channel selection are proposed and compared in terms of optimality, scalability, and robustness. The power allocation, on the other hand, is formulated as a real optimization problem and solved, during the second phase, by traditional optimization solvers. Simulation results show that energy and cross-layer awareness and multiple channel access capability improve the performance of the system in terms of the per-user average rewards received from accessing the dynamic spectrum access system. In addition, the two proposed methods for channel selection via learning represent a tradeoff between optimality, scalability, and robustness.},

abstract={The transmission capacity of wireless networks is limited by the intensity of the interference received from concurrent transmissions. Interference causes serious performance degradation, particularly when no centralized controller within the network exists. Cognitive radio (CR) is a promising solution for distributed interference management as users with CR capabilities can acquire local activity and position information to achieve spatial reuse while limiting interference to neighboring users. Considering a two-tier network consisting of a licensed primary network overlaid by an unlicensed secondary tier, this paper proposes CR-based spectrum access schemes for secondary users (SUs). Acquiring the activity information of nearby users, the SUs are activated only when they are outside the exclusion zone of primary receivers. Additionally, the active secondary transmitters are separated from each other by forming secondary exclusion zones around themselves. Using stochastic geometry, primary and secondary exclusion zone sizes that maximize the transmission capacity under per-tier outage constraints are calculated. Analytical results supported by numerical simulations, suggest primary exclusion zones reduce predominantly the cross-tier interference while the secondary exclusion zone size is critical in mitigating the interference among SUs.},

abstract={This paper investigates double-threshold-based energy detector for cooperative spectrum sensing mechanisms in cognitive wireless radio networks. We first propose a hybrid double-threshold-based energy detector (HDTED) to improve the sensing performance at secondary users (SUs) by exploiting both the local binary/energy decisions and global binary decisions feedback from the fusion center (FC). Significantly, we derive closed-form expressions and bounds for the probabilities of missed detection and false alarm considering a practical scenario where all channel links suffer from Rayleigh fading and background noise. The derived expressions not only show the improved performance achieved with the HDTED scheme but also enable us to analyze the impacts of the number of the SUs and the fading channels on the cooperative spectrum sensing performance. Furthermore, based on the derived bounds, we propose an optimal SU selection algorithm for forwarding the local decisions to the FC, which helps reduce the number of forwarding bits for a lower-complexity signaling. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the validity of the analytical findings.},

year={2016},
volume={64},
number={3},
pages={1143-1152},
abstract={The adjacent channel interference (ACI) resulting from imperfect filtering can severely degrade the performance of any wireless communication system. Despite this fact, most of previously proposed medium access control (MAC) protocols for cognitive radio networks (CRNs) were designed while ignoring the effects of ACI (assuming ideal filtering). The effect of ACI can be reduced by introducing guard bands (GBs). However, this solution comes at the expense of degrading spectrum efficiency. In this paper, we develop an efficient GB-aware MAC protocol that attempts at maximizing network throughput while improving fairness in CRNs. Unlike most of previously proposed GB-aware MAC protocols that perform channel assignment sequentially, our MAC performs the channel assignment for multiple CR links simultaneously (the so-called batch method). Batching enables concurrent channel assignment for multiple CR links, which consequently allows for concurrent data transmissions. Batching can be realized by introducing an admission control phase for CR users to share their control information. The batch method can effectively provide distributed decisions that achieve better throughput while reducing the number of GBs. Our MAC also allows the CR users to utilize the reserved GBs of primary networks under predefined FCC power constraints. Simulation results indicate that our protocol achieves significant performance improvement compared to previous GB-aware protocols.},

year={2016},

pages={3044-3057},
abstract={This paper considers the precoder design for multiantenna secure cognitive radio networks. We use finite-alphabet inputs as the signaling and exploit statistical channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. We maximize the secrecy rate of the secondary user and control the transmit power and the power leakage to the primary receivers that share the same frequency spectrum. The secrecy rate maximization is important for practical systems, but challenging to solve, mainly due to two reasons. First, the secrecy rate with statistical CSI is computationally prohibitive to evaluate. Second, the optimization over the precoder is a nondeterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problem. We utilize an accurate approximation of the secrecy rate to reduce the computational effort and then propose a global optimization approach based on branch-and-bound method. The idea is to define a simplex and transform the secrecy rate into a concave function. The derived concave function converges to the secrecy rate when the defined simplex shrinks down. Using this feature, we solve a sequence of concave maximization problems over iteratively shrinking simplices and eventually attain the globally optimal solution that maximizes the approximation of the secrecy rate. When the complexity is concerned, a low-complexity variant with limited number of iterations can be used in practice. We demonstrate the performance gains when compared with others through numerical examples.},

abstract={Improper Gaussian signaling has the ability over proper (conventional) Gaussian signaling to improve the achievable rate of systems that suffer from interference. In this paper, we study the impact of using improper Gaussian signaling on the performance limits of the underlay cognitive radio system by analyzing the achievable outage probability of both the primary user (PU) and secondary user (SU). We derive the exact outage probability expression of the SU and construct upper and lower bounds of the PU outage probability which results in formulating an approximate expression of the PU outage probability. This allows us to design the SU signal by adjusting its transmitted power and the circularity coefficient to minimize the SU outage probability while maintaining a certain PU quality-of-service. Finally, we evaluate the derived expressions for both the SU and the PU and the corresponding adaptive algorithms by numerical results.},

abstract={Cooperative spectrum sensing, despite its effectiveness in enabling dynamic spectrum access, suffers from location privacy threats, merely because secondary users (SUs)' sensing reports that need to be shared with a fusion center to make spectrum availability decisions are highly correlated to the users' locations. It is therefore important that cooperative spectrum sensing schemes be empowered with privacy preserving capabilities so as to provide SUs with incentives for participating in the sensing task. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy preserving protocol that uses an additional architectural entity and makes use of various cryptographic mechanisms to preserve the location privacy of SUs while performing reliable and efficient spectrum sensing. We show that not only is our proposed scheme secure and more efficient than existing alternatives, but also achieves fault tolerance and is robust against sporadic network topological changes.},

abstract={Cognitive radio sensor network (CRSN) has emerged as a promising solution to address the spectrum scarcity problem in traditional sensor networks, by enabling sensor nodes to opportunistically access licensed spectrum. To protect the transmission of primary users and enhance spectrum utilization, collaborative spectrum sensing is generally adopted for improving spectrum sensing accuracy. However, as sensor nodes may be compromised by adversaries, these nodes can send false sensing reports to mislead the spectrum sensing decision, making CRSNs vulnerable to spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attacks. Meanwhile, since the energy consumption of spectrum sensing is considerable for energy-limited sensor nodes, SSDF attack countermeasures should be carefully devised with the consideration of energy efficiency. To this end, we propose a secure and energy-efficient collaborative spectrum sensing scheme to resist SSDF attacks and enhance the energy efficiency in CRSNs. Specifically, we theoretically analyze the impacts of two types of attacks, i.e., independent and collaborative SSDF attacks, on the accuracy of collaborative spectrum sensing in a probabilistic way. To maximize the energy efficiency of spectrum sensing, we calculate the minimum number of sensor nodes needed for spectrum sensing to guarantee the desired accuracy of sensing results. Moreover, a trust evaluation scheme, named FastDtec, is developed to evaluate the spectrum sensing behaviors and fast identify compromised nodes. Finally, a secure and energy-efficient collaborative spectrum sensing scheme is proposed to further improve the energy efficiency of collaborative spectrum sensing, by adaptively isolating the identified compromised nodes from spectrum sensing. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can resist SSDF attacks and significantly improve the energy efficiency of collaborative spectrum sensing.},

abstract={In this paper, distributed competitive interactions between a secondary user (SU) transmitter-receiver pair and a jammer are investigated using a game-theoretic framework under physical interference restrictions, power budget constraints, and incomplete knowledge of channel gains. In this game, the SU transmitter is expected to choose its power strategy with the objective of satisfying a minimum signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) at the corresponding receiver. Similarly, the jammer's objective is to strategically allocate its power so that the SINR constraint of the SU is not satisfied. Due to a lack of complete information, this strategic power allocation problem between the two players is modeled as a Bayesian game for which the self-enforcing strategies of the SU transmitter-receiver pair and the jammer are analyzed. Furthermore, probability distributions are employed by the corresponding players to model the incomplete nature of the game. The solution of the game corresponds to Nash equilibria points. Equilibrium analysis is carried out by considering the mixed strategy solution space and numerical examples are presented for illustration.},

volume={16},
number={5},
pages={2790-2806},
abstract={To enhance the national security, there is a growing need for authorized parties to legitimately monitor suspicious communication links for preventing intended crimes and terror attacks. In this paper, we propose a new wireless information surveillance paradigm by investigating a scenario, where a legitimate monitor aims to intercept a suspicious wireless link over fading channels. The legitimate monitor can successfully eavesdrop (decode) the information of the suspicious link at each fading state only when its achievable data rate is no smaller than that at the suspicious receiver. We propose a new approach, namely, proactive eavesdropping via cognitive jamming, in which the legitimate monitor purposely jams the receiver in a full-duplex mode so as to change the suspicious communication (e.g., to a smaller data rate) for overhearing more efficiently. By assuming perfect self-interference cancelation (SIC) and global channel state information (CSI) at the legitimate monitor, we characterize the fundamental information-theoretic limits of proactive eavesdropping. We consider both delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant applications for the suspicious communication, under which the legitimate monitor maximizes the eavesdropping non-outage probability (for event-based monitoring) and the relative eavesdropping rate (for content analysis), respectively, by optimizing the jamming power allocation over different fading states subject to an average power constraint. Numerical results show that the proposed proactive eavesdropping via cognitive jamming approach greatly outperforms other benchmark schemes. Furthermore, by extending to a more practical scenario with residual SI and local CSI, we design an efficient online cognitive jamming scheme inspired by the optimal cognitive jamming with perfect SIC and global CSI.},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel power beacon-assisted wiretap channel, where an energy constrained source, powered by a dedicated power beacon, aims to establish secure communications with a legitimate user in the presence of an eavesdropper. The power beacon and the source are assumed to have multiple antennas, while the legitimate user and the eavesdropper are equipped with a single antenna each. Considering a time-switching protocol, the power beacon first charges the source through wireless power transfer, and then acts as a friendly jammer to assist the source for secure communication. Depending on the available channel state information (CSI) at the power beacon, we propose several different jamming schemes for secrecy performance enhancement. Closed-form expressions are derived for the achievable secrecy outage probability of the proposed schemes. In addition, simple and accurate approximations are obtained at the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. The outcomes suggest that jamming is an effective approach to improve the secrecy performance: with full CSI available at the power beacon, employing simple zero-forcing scheme attains significant secrecy diversity gain and without the CSI of the eavesdropper link, jamming provides only some array gain. Moreover, we show that the proposed limited feedback-based random beamforming is an effective approach, which may outperform the antenna selection scheme. Furthermore, numerical results reveal that there exists a unique time switching ratio that maximizes the effective secrecy throughput.},

abstract={Wideband spectrum sensing is regarded as one of the key features in cognitive radio systems. Compressive sensing (CS) has recently become one of the promising techniques to deal with the Nyquist sampling rate bottleneck of wideband spectrum sensing. Theoretical analyses and simulation have shown that CS could achieve high detection probability and low false alarm for wideband spectrum sensing. However, implementation of CS on the real-time signals and real-time processing poses significant challenges due to the iterative nature of the CS algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptively regularized iterative reweighted least squares (AR-IRLS) algorithm to implement the real-time signal recovery on the CS based wideband spectrum sensing. The proposed algorithm moves estimated solutions along an exponential-linear path by regularizing weights with a series of non- increasing penalty terms, which significantly speeds up the convergence of reconstruction and provides high fidelity guarantee to cope with the varying bandwidths and power levels of occupied channels. The proposed algorithm presents robustness against different sparsity levels at low compressive ratio without degradation on the reconstruction performance, and is tested on the real-time signals over TV white space spectrum after having been validated on the simulated signals. Both the simulation and real-time experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithms in terms of convergence speed, reconstruction accuracy, and compressive ratio requirement.},

abstract={In this letter, a new spectrum sensing strategy is proposed for primary users (PUs), which are dynamic whereby it is assumed that at least one and possibly multiple PU status changes occur in the channel during the sensing period. According to our proposed strategy, the last status change point of the PU is estimated first using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Then, any known spectrum sensing method can be applied to the observed samples between this last status change point and the end of the sensing period. By this way, degradation in probability of detection due to PU traffic is lessened. Dynamic programming (DP) is used to accelerate computation of the MLE. We also propose a new cumulative sum (CuSum) based weighting scheme. Simulations indicate that the proposed sensing strategy provides an improvement in terms of probability of detection for all the considered spectrum sensing methods. Furthermore, the proposed CuSum based weighting scheme achieves the best probability of detection when employed together with the last status change point estimation strategy.},

abstract={The last decade has witnessed a booming era of wireless vehicular networks, supporting diverse road traffic services and applications. Information dissemination/sharing among vehicles is the fundamental goal of vehicular networks. Although diverse information dissemination/sharing mechanisms have been proposed in the existing literature, the physical layer outage performance of information sharing has not been analyzed. Against this background, in this paper, we study the outage probability of road traffic information sharing in underlay cognitive vehicular networks under both a general scenario and a specific highway scenario. The general scenario relies on the Nakagami-m channel, while the highway scenario is its special case associated with the Rayleigh fading channel. Moreover, we also invoke a real-world dataset containing the locations of Beijing taxis to conduct simulations, the results of which verify the accuracy of our theoretical analysis.},

pages={150-161},
abstract={In this paper, we address energy efficient (EE) cooperative spectrum sensing policies for large scale heterogeneous cognitive radio networks (CRNs) which consist of multiple primary channels and large number of secondary users (SUs) with heterogeneous sensing and reporting channel qualities. We approach this issue from macro and micro perspectives. Macro perspective groups SUs into clusters with the objectives: 1) total energy consumption minimization; 2) total throughput maximization; and 3) inter-cluster energy and throughput fairness. We adopt and demonstrate how to solve these using the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II. The micro perspective, on the other hand, operates as a sub-procedure on cluster formations decided by the macro perspective. For the micro perspectives, we first propose a procedure to select the cluster head (CH) which yields: 1) the best CH which gives the minimum total multi-hop error rate and 2) the optimal routing paths from SUs to the CH. Exploiting Poisson-Binomial distribution, a novel and generalized K-out-of-N voting rule is developed for heterogeneous CRNs to allow SUs to have different local detection performances. Then, a convex optimization framework is established to minimize the intra-cluster energy cost by jointly obtaining the optimal sensing durations and thresholds of feature detectors for the proposed voting rule. Likewise, instead of a common fixed sample size test, we developed a weighted sample size test for quantized soft decision fusion to obtain a more EE regime under heterogeneity. We have shown that the combination of proposed CH selection and cooperation schemes gives a superior performance in terms of energy efficiency and robustness against reporting error wall.},

abstract={Sharing the spectrum with in-band full-duplex (FD) primary users (PUs) is a challenging and interesting problem in the underlay cognitive radio systems. The self-interference introduced at the primary network may dramatically impede the secondary user (SU) opportunity to access the spectrum. To tackle this problem, we use the so-called improper Gaussian signaling. Particularly, we assume the downlink transmission of a SU that uses improper Gaussian signaling while the FD PU pair implements the regular proper Gaussian signaling. First, we derive a closed-form expression and an upper bound for the SU and PUs outage probabilities, respectively. Second, we optimize the SU signal parameters to minimize its outage probability while maintaining the required PUs quality-of-service based on the average channel state information (CSI). Moreover, we provide the conditions to reap merits from employing improper Gaussian signaling at the SU. Third, we design the SU signal parameters based on the perfect knowledge of its direct link instantaneous CSI and investigate all benefits that can be achieved at both the SU and PUs. Finally, we provide some numerical results that demonstrate the advantages of using improper Gaussian signaling to access the spectrum of the FD PUs.},

abstract={We propose an adaptive transmission scheme for cognitive decode-and-forward relaying networks, whereby, before each communication process, one out of three transmission modes is dynamically selected in order to maximize the instantaneous capacity of the system, namely, half-duplex (HD) relaying, full-duplex (FD) relaying, or direct transmission with no cooperation. The following key issues, relevant to underlay spectrum sharing and cooperative relaying, are considered: 1) the overall transmit power at the secondary network is constrained by both the maximum tolerable interference at the primary receiver and the maximum transmit power available at the secondary nodes; 2) under FD operation, the secondary relay is subject to residual self-interference, which is modeled as a fading channel; and 3) the signals coming from the secondary source and relay are handled at the secondary destination via maximal-ratio combining, in the HD relaying mode, and via a joint-decoding technique, in the FD relaying mode. We derive an exact analytical expression for the outage probability of the proposed scheme. Then, an approximate closed-form expression is proposed, and a corresponding asymptotic expression is derived. Monte Carlo simulations are run to validate the accuracy of the presented mathematical analysis and to showcase the tightness of the proposed approximation.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider a multichannel cognitive radio network, where cooperative secondary users have heterogeneous sensing ability in terms of their sensing accuracy. We employ a group-based cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) scheme in which cooperating secondary users are grouped such that different groups are responsible for sensing different channels. In this group-based CSS scheme, channels sharing the same cooperating users are scheduled to sense in different sensing rounds. In this work, we propose adaptively assigning the heterogeneous cooperating secondary users to different groups to maximize the throughput efficiency while maintaining a predefined sensing accuracy. To this end, we analytically derive a closed-form expression for the throughput efficiency in terms of the average opportunistic throughput and average sensing overhead. We also formulate the throughput efficiency maximization problem for heterogeneous secondary users as a nonlinear binary programming problem, which is computationally intractable. We then propose three efficient adaptive assignment heuristics that perform the assignment of users to groups and the assignment of those groups to the sensing rounds such that the throughput efficiency is maximized. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed assignment heuristics can achieve near optimal performance with low computational complexity and can also improve the throughput efficiency significantly compared to the existing nonadaptive assignment and sequential CSS schemes.},

abstract={As a critical technique to support the multimedia services - the major traffic in cooperative cognitive radio networks (CRNs), the statistical quality-of-service (QoS) technique has been proved to be effective in statistically guaranteeing delay-bounded video transmissions over the time- varying wireless channels. On the other hand, in modern cooperative CRNs, the full-duplex spectrum sensing (FD-SS) scheme is designed to be a promising candidate technique for fully utilizing the channel spectrum while significantly enhancing the performance. However, how to efficiently integrate the FD-SS technique in supporting statistical QoS over cooperative CRNs imposes many new challenges not met before. To effectively overcome the above-mentioned difficulties, we propose the QoS-driven resource allocation scheme to implement FD-SS based multimedia services in cooperative CRNs. In particular, under the Nakagami-m channel model, we establish the cooperative spectrum sharing system model. We develop the FD-SS scheme and derive the probabilities of miss detection and false alarm for the proposed FD-SS scheme over cooperative CRNs. Given the statistical QoS constraints, we analyze the effective capacity and our proposed optimal resource allocation policy using the proposed FD-SS architecture over cooperative CRNs. Also conducted is a set of simulations which evaluate the system performance and show that our proposed resource allocation policy can achieve the optimality under the statistical delay-bounded QoS constraints over cooperative CRNs.},

abstract={This paper considers co-operation between primary and secondary users in shared spectrum radio networks via caching. We first consider a network with one channel shared between a single macro (primary) base station and multiple micro (secondary) base stations. Secondary base stations can cache some primary files and thereby satisfy content requests generated from nearby primary users. For this co-operative scenario, we develop two caching and scheduling policies under which the set of primary and secondary request generation rates that can be supported increases from the case without cooperation. The first of these algorithms, fixed primary caching policy (FPCP), provides more gain in the set of supportable request generation rates. However under this algorithm primary packet transmissions from secondary base stations have the same priority of access as secondary packets and thus might suffer in terms of delay. In the second algorithm, variable primary caching policy (VPCP), primary packet transmissions from the secondary base stations have higher priority of access than that of secondary packets. We find that the set of request generation rate vectors for which all queues in the network are stable under each of these algorithms is greater than that under any non-cooperative algorithm. We conduct extensive simulations to compare the performance of both algorithms against that of an optimal noncooperative algorithm. Finally, we extend the analysis to a network with multiple channels.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a spectrum auction mechanism for secondary spectrum access in cognitive radio networks. Different from existing works in the literature, the time-dependent buyer valuation information is employed in the proposed mechanism so that the primary spectrum owner (PO) can determine more favorable spectrum allocations and pricing functions in order to maximize the expected auction revenue. In addition, to exploit the temporal spectrum reusability, the proposed mechanism allows each secondary wireless user to declare its specific time preferences, including service starting time, delay tolerance, and service length. By further considering the heterogeneities in secondary wireless service provisioning, the proposed mechanism is able to support heterogeneous forms (continuous or disjointed spectrum usages) of secondary spectrum requests. Specifically, at the beginning of the auction frame, secondary wireless users report their different spectrum usage requests along with the bidding prices, while the PO decides a single-step spectrum allocation and calculates the payment for each winner based on not only the received bids but also the known time-dependent valuation information. Theoretical analyses and simulation results show that the proposed auction mechanism can satisfy all desired economic properties, and can improve the spectrum allocation efficiency and auction revenue compared with counterparts.},

abstract={In this paper, an underlay based cognitive radio network (CRN) consisting of a secondary base station (SBS), a secondary receiver (SR), an energy harvesting node (EHN), and a primary transmitter-receiver (PT-PR) pair, is considered. The EHN is assumed to have a power splitter (PS) at the receiver to decode information and harvest energy simultaneously from the SBS transmission, thus reducing the secrecy capacity of SBS. Since both the SBS and the malicious EHN are selfish with conflicting interests, we model the interaction between them as a non-cooperative Stackelberg game. The objective of the SBS is to maximize the secrecy rate and minimize its interference at the PR, whereas the EHN aims at maximizing both the energy it can harvest and the information it can decode from the received SBS signal. The existence of a unique equilibrium point is proved through mathematical analysis. Further, a distributed algorithm is proposed, following which the players will attain the equilibrium of the game as predicted by analytical results. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate that both SBS and EHN can achieve their optimal utilities by adopting the equilibrium strategy.},

One scheme employs maximal-ratio combining (DAS/MRC) at the destination, whereas the other employs selection combining (DAS/SC). We consider a dual-hop fixed-gain amplify-and-forward relaying network, equipped with multi-antenna source/relay nodes and a single-antenna destination. A lower bound expression is derived for the outage probability of each investigated scheme. Importantly, the derived bounds prove to be very tight approximations to the exact outage performance. Also, capitalizing on a strikingly interesting property of Stirling numbers of the second kind, we provide closed-form asymptotic expressions for the obtained bounds. Our results show that the diversity order of the proposed distributed schemes is identical to that of their optimal centralized counterparts, namely Nt + min(Nrr, Nrt), with Nt, Nrr, and Nrt denoting the number of transmit antennas at the source, the number of receive antennas at the relay, and the number of transmit antennas at the relay, respectively. In addition, as the relay approaches the destination, the outage performance of the proposed schemes approaches the optimal one.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel spectrum underlay approach for secondary users where a permutation trellis code (PTC) is employed in conjunction with multi-level frequency shift keying signaling in the presence of multiple narrowband primary users (PUs). The PUs are assumed to be dynamic in that they appear intermittently and stay active for an unknown duration. Our proposed approach derives its resilience to the interference caused by PUs and noise disturbances via dispersal of the information in SU's messages over multiple frequencies and time intervals. Our proposed underlay-design improves the SU data rate by accumulating a large amount of spectrum from several PUs, while simultaneously operating at low power to minimize the interference caused at PUs' receivers. We evaluate our system performance in terms of bit error rate (BER) and throughput by approximating the actual BER using properties of the Viterbi decoder. We corroborate our analytical results with simulation results and show that our proposed coded system is robust to heavy interference caused by multiple narrowband PUs.},

In such a framework, the quality of service (QoS) requirements for both the primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs) should be met. We propose a novel PA algorithm, which fully exploits the characteristics of NOMA-based system. The QoS requirements for PUs are guaranteed through the setup of the overall power for SUs. In addition, it provides PA in a descending order, according to SUs' channel gains. It is validated that the proposed algorithm is optimal. To show its effectiveness, it is compared with one of the most efficient PA algorithms, namely fractional transmit power control (FTPC). The superiority of the proposed algorithm is thoroughly verified by simulation results. Additionally, the computational complexity of our proposed algorithm is only linear, i.e., O(N).},

year={2016},
volume={64},

pages={1384-1398},
abstract={Spectrum access strategy plays a critical role in multichannel cognitive radio networks (CRNs). However, the CRNs cannot obtain the maximal throughput, when the existing access strategies, including overlay, underlay, and hybrid access strategies, are applied to multichannel CRNs. In this paper, we present a generalized access strategy in a multichannel CRN smart home environment, in which a secondary user (SU) system selects part of channels for sequential spectrum sensing, and accesses these channels based on the sensing results. Moreover, it accesses the remaining channels directly. We then formulate a two-phase optimization framework, which takes the sensing channel selection, sensing time allocation, and the power allocation into consideration, to maximize the gross average throughput of the multichannel CRN. In the sensing phase, a generalized access strategy algorithm (GAS) is first proposed, where we prove that only part of channels needs to be selected for spectrum sensing to achieve the maximum throughput. An optimal stopping rule is proposed to determine the optimal number of selected sensing channels. In addition, a completed hybrid access strategy algorithm is further investigated where the SU system senses all channels. An approximation algorithm is also presented to achieve suboptimal results with low computational complexity. In the transmission phase, the transmission powers of all channels are optimized via convex algorithms. Numerical experiments show that, compared with the existing schemes, the proposed schemes are able to achieve considerable throughput improvement.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose an extensible and flexible truthful auction framework that is individually-rational and self-collusion resistant. By properly setting one simple parameter, this framework yields efficient auctions (like Vickery–Clarke–Groves), (sub)optimal auctions (like Myerson’s optimal mechanism), and budget-balanced double auctions; by carefully choosing virtual valuation functions for the bidders, it can produce attribute-aware auctions that take the channel diversity into consideration. The framework adopts a novel procedure that can prevent bidder self-collusion resulted from the bid diversity. In order to reduce the computational complexity of our framework, we propose a greedy auction scheme that possesses all the economic properties of our auction framework. We also prove the performance bound of the greedy algorithm under certain condition. Theoretical analysis and case studies demonstrate the strength of our auction framework in handling various considerations in a practical heterogeneous spectrum market.},

The proposed protocol guarantees the quality of service (QoS) required by the primary network. In this regard, licensed users lease part of their spectrum to unlicensed users to retransmit the failed packets on the licensed users' behalf. By doing so, the unlicensed users obtain greater opportunity for data transmission, thus increasing their performance.

pages={973-986},
abstract={In cognitive radio networks, the cross-channel gain from a cognitive transmitter (CT) to a primary receiver (PR) is critical for spectrum sharing and obtaining the cross-channel gain is very difficult. Even though proactive estimation allows the CT to autonomously estimate the cross-channel gain, it may cause severe interference to the PR. This raises a new issue for spectrum sensing, called spectrum sensing interference. In this paper, we deal with the sensing interference and propose a relay-assisted method to conduct the proactive estimation, which obtains the cross-channel gain with much less interference to the PR. In our method, we let the CT act as a full-duplex amplify-and-forward relay to probe the close-loop power control between primary transceivers. By measuring the power adjustment of the primary signal, the CT estimates the cross-channel gain. Simulation results indicate that our method can reduce the sensing interference to an extremely low level.},

abstract={We introduce the concept of cognitive cloud offloading where all viable wireless interfaces of a multiple radio enabled device are used for computation offloading. We propose a time and wireless adaptive heuristic for offloading computationally intensive applications to a remote cloud with goals of reducing the energy consumption on the mobile device, execution time of the application, and efficient use of the multiple radio interfaces available at the device. The proposed algorithms simultaneously determine: 1) execution place of each application component (mobile/cloud); 2) amount of the associated data to be sent via each available interface of the multiple radio access technology device; and 3) scheduling order of the application components. We define a net utility function that trades off mobile device resources (battery, CPU, and memory) with realtime communication costs, such as latency and communication energy, subject to constraints that ensure queue stability of radio interfaces. Simulations using real data from an HTC smartphone running multi-component applications with Amazon EC2 as the cloud, and two radios, LTE and WiFi, show that cognitive cloud offloading provides higher net utility in comparison to the best-interface protocol. Scalability of the proposed heuristic is further analyzed using various levels for component dependency graphs and energy-delay trade-off factors.},

abstract={Based on the concept of reconfigurable antennas (RAs), space-shift keying (SSK)-RA has been recently proposed as a novel transmission scheme to improve the performance of SSK. In this context, it has been shown that RAs' reconfigurable properties can be used as additional degrees of freedom to enhance the throughput, implementation complexity, and error performance of SSK. In this paper, we study the implementation of SSK-RA within underlay cognitive radio systems in an effort to improve the performance of the secondary user while verifying the constraints set by the primary user (PU). Taking advantage of the interplay between RAs and the propagation channels for both the secondary and interference links, we propose an RA-based scheme with beam-direction reconfiguration aiming at improving the secondary system's performance while verifying an outage interference constraint to the PU. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the proposed scheme in Rician fading channels and provide simulation examples confirming these analytical results. The proposed schemes are shown to offer enhanced bit error rate performance and lower implementation complexity when compared with conventional antenna-based spectrum sharing systems.},

abstract={In this paper, the operation of a full-duplex (FD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) underlay cognitive radio (CR) network is studied. Each pair of secondary users (SUs) operate in FD mode, and each SU communicates with its peer within the coverage area of multiple primary users (PUs). Each SU suffers from self-interference, along with interference created by all other SUs and, in its turn, generates interference towards the PU. We assume that the channel-state-information (CSI) of the interference links between the SUs and the PU is imperfectly known and the channel estimation errors are norm bounded. Under such channel uncertainties, we address the problem of robust minimization of the aggregate mean-squared-error (MSE) of all estimated symbols, subject to a set of transmit power constraints, as well as interference constraints, with the aim of protecting PU communication. It is shown that the problem can be cast as a semidefinite programming problem and the optimal precoding matrices can be obtained via an iterative algorithm. By means of simulation, the proposed FD precoding scheme is shown to outperform the standard half-duplex scheme.},

abstract={Collaborative spectrum sensing exploits multiuser diversity by combining spectrum sensing information from multiple secondary users to make joint decisions about spectrum occupancy. In hard fusion schemes, each secondary user makes a hard decision on spectrum occupancy and a fusion center makes a final decision by combining the individual hard decisions according to a fusion rule. In soft fusion schemes, each secondary user provides a signal power measurement to the fusion center, which performs further processing on the collection of all observations to make a final decision. In this paper, we propose hard and soft fusion collaborative spectrum sensing schemes based on the online hidden bivariate Markov chain modeling of the signals received by secondary users. Compared with prior collaborative sensing schemes, the proposed model-based schemes do not rely on precomputed thresholds or weights, and achieve superior performance. The online estimation of hidden bivariate Markov models provides predictive information that can be used to improve the performance of the dynamic spectrum access. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance and communication overhead tradeoffs of the proposed collaborative spectrum sensing schemes.},

abstract={It is envisaged that there will be heterogeneous deployment of ultra-dense femtocells overlaying the existing macrocells in an ad-hoc manner to provide enhanced coverage and capacity for the indoor users in the fifth generation (5G) wireless networks. However, this will lead to serious interference between macrocells and femtocells (cross-tier interference) and interference between neighbouring femtocells (co-tier interference), which can adversely affect the performance of the overall network. Hence, radio resource management (RRM) must be done in an intelligent way to mitigate both cross-tier and co-tier interference. Most of the existing RRM algorithms in the literature do not effectively address these problems. Moreover, most of these algorithms are not scalable and therefore not efficient for networks with massive deployment of femtocells. Motivated by these shortcomings, in this paper, we present a self-organizing radio resource allocation algorithm (SORRAA) for resource allocation and interference management based on cognitive radio (CR) technology and stochastic process (SP). The resource allocation problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem and the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using MATLAB. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm improves the overall throughput and reduces interference when compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

number={9},
pages={3872-3885},
abstract={We consider the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap channel under a minimum receiver-side power constraint in addition to the usual maximum transmitter-side power constraint. This problem is motivated by energy harvesting communications with wireless energy transfer, where an added goal is to deliver a minimum amount of energy to a receiver in addition to delivering secure data to another receiver. In this paper, we characterize the exact secrecy capacity of the MIMO wiretap channel under transmitter and receiver-side power constraints. We first show that solving this problem is equivalent to solving the secrecy capacity of the wiretap channel under a double-sided correlation matrix constraint on the channel input. We show the converse by extending the channel enhancement technique to our case. We present two achievable schemes that achieve the secrecy capacity: the first achievable scheme uses a Gaussian codebook with a fixed mean, and the second achievable scheme uses artificial noise (or cooperative jamming) together with a Gaussian codebook. The role of the mean or the artificial noise is to enable energy transfer without sacrificing from the secure rate. This is the first instance of a channel model where either the use of a mean signal or the use of channel prefixing via artificial noise is strictly necessary for the MIMO wiretap channel. We then extend our work to consider a maximum receiver-side power constraint instead of a minimum receiver-side power constraint. This problem is motivated by cognitive radio applications, where an added goal is to decrease the received signal energy (interference temperature) at a receiver. We further extend our results to: requiring receiver-side power constraints at both receivers; considering secrecy constraints at both receivers to study broadcast channels with confidential messages; and removing the secrecy constraints to study the classical broadcast channel.},

Both PRS and ORS schemes are found to attain full diversity for low target rates only, otherwise a relay cooperation ceiling (RCC) phenomenon occurs.

abstract={In this paper, we study cooperative precoder design in two-tier networks, consisting of a macro-cell (MC) and several small-cells (SCs). By exploiting multiuser Vandermonde-subspace frequency division multiplexing (VFDM) transmission, an MC downlink can co-exist with cognitive SCs. In this paper, we first propose a cooperative cross-tier precoder (CTP) among the transmitters in the SCs to increase the transmitted dimension. The cooperative CTP allows us to use more efficient intra-tier precoder (ITP) in SCs to handle intracell interference and improve the throughput of the cognitive system. And then, three ITPs, a block-diagonal zero-forcing (BD-ZF) ITP, a capacity-achieving (CA) ITP, and a generalized MMSE channel inversion (GMI) ITP, are developed. Complexities of all CTPs and ITPs are discussed and compared. The overhead of channel state information (CSI) exchange is analyzed. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the throughput improvement of the proposed schemes and to discover the impact of the imperfect CSI. From the complexity comparison and the numerical results, the GMI ITP offers a good tradeoff between complexity and throughput.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the problem of jammer selection for securing Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks (CCRNs) with the Multiple-Input Multiple- Output (MIMO) capability. In the CCRN under our consideration, there exist a pair of Primary Users (PUs), a relay node, a number of Secondary User (SU) pairs, and an eavesdropper. The PUs need to select a pair of SUs as jammers to interfere with the eavesdropper so as to preserve the secrecy of their wireless communications. To address this problem, we propose an Optimal Stopping based Jammer Selection (OSJS) scheme. Specifically, OSJS examines the primary secrecy capacity for each candidate SU pair in a sequential order. The first SU pair that makes the primary secrecy capacity higher than an optimal threshold is selected as the jammers. The optimal threshold is calculated based on the distribution function of the primary secrecy capacity. We derive the distribution function from the chi-square distribution function of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) under the MIMO channel conditions. Since our OSJS scheme does not have to check all the candidate SU pairs, much time can be saved for data transmissions. Our rigorous analysis and simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can achieve secure communications with improved network throughput.},

abstract={We consider linear precoding design for an underlay cognitive radio multiple-input multiple-output broadcast channel in the presence of multiple primary users (PUs).

The design problem is non-convex, and thus is difficult to solve in general.

abstract={We characterize the rate complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) for a spectrum-shared millimeter wave downlink cellular network. Each of multiple cellular operators owns separate mmWave bandwidth, but shares the spectrum amongst each other while using dynamic inter-operator base station (BS) coordination to suppress the resulting cross-operator interference. We model the BS locations of each operator as mutually independent Poisson point processes, and derive the probability density function (PDF) of the K-th strongest link power, incorporating both line-of-sight and non line-of-sight states. Leveraging the obtained PDF, we derive the rate CCDF expression as a function of system parameters such as the BS density, transmit power, bandwidth, and coordination set size. We verify the analysis with extensive simulation results. A major finding is that inter-operator BS coordination is useful in spectrum sharing (i) with dense and high power operators and (ii) with fairly wide beams, e.g., 30∘ or higher.},

abstract={Competing cellular operators aggressively share infrastructure in many major US markets. If operators also were to share spectrum in next-generation millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks, intra-cellular interference will become correlated with inter-cellular interference. We propose a mathematical framework to model a multi-operator mmWave cellular network with co-located base-stations (BSs). We then characterize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) distribution for an arbitrary network and derive its coverage probability. To understand how varying the spatial correlation between different networks affects coverage probability, we derive special results for the two-operator scenario, where we construct the operators’ individual networks from a single network via probabilistic coupling. For external validation, we devise a method to quantify and estimate spatial correlation from actual BS deployments. We compare our two-operator model against an actual macro-cell-dominated network and an actual network primarily comprising distributed-antenna-system (DAS) nodes. Using the actual deployment data to set the parameters of our model, we observe that coverage probabilities for the model and actual deployments not only compare very well to each other, but also match nearly perfectly for the case of the DAS-node-dominated deployment. Another interesting observation is that a network that shares spectrum and infrastructure has a lower rate coverage probability at low rate thresholds than a network of the same number of BSs that shares neither spectrum nor infrastructure, suggesting that the latter is more suitable for low-rate applications.},

abstract={Two emerging technologies toward 5G wireless networks, namely non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and cognitive radio (CR), will provide more efficient utilization of wireless spectrum in the future. In this article, we investigate the integration of NOMA with CR into a holistic system, namely a cognitive NOMA network, for more intelligent spectrum sharing. Design principles of cognitive NOMA networks are perfectly aligned to functionality requirements of 5G wireless networks, such as high spectrum efficiency, massive connectivity, low latency, and better fairness. Three different cognitive NOMA architectures are presented, including underlay NOMA networks, overlay NOMA networks, and CR-inspired NOMA networks. To address inter-network and intra-network interference, which largely degrade the performance of cognitive NOMA networks, cooperative relaying strategies are proposed. For each cognitive NOMA architecture, our proposed cooperative relaying strategy shows its potential to significantly lower outage probabilities. We discuss open challenges and future research directions on implementation of cognitive NOMA networks.},

abstract={A novel cognitive interference control framework for heterogeneous local access networks supporting computing and data processing in Urban Internet of Things (IoT) systems is presented. The notion of cognitive content-aware interference control is introduced, where the transmission pattern of cognitive nodes is dynamically adapted to the state of “protected” IoT data streams. The state describes the performance degradation that interference would cause to algorithms processing the data if the cognitive nodes would chose to transmit in the corresponding time period. The framework is instantiated for a case-study scenario where Device-to-Device and Long-Term Evolution communications coexist on the same channel resource. A city-monitoring application is considered, where the state captures the type of frames within a multimedia video stream processed at the edge of the network to detect and track objects. Numerical results show that the proposed cognitive transmission strategy enables a significant throughput increase of local D2D communications for a target accuracy of the monitoring application.},

number={99},

abstract={In cognitive radio (CR) networks, the secondary users (SUs) sense the spectrum licensed to the primary users (PUs) to identify and possibly transmit over temporarily unoccupied channels. Cooperative sensing was proposed to improve the sensing accuracy, but in heterogeneous scenarios SUs do not contribute equally to the cooperative sensing result because they experience different received PU signal quality at their sensors. In this paper, a two-layer cooperative game is developed for distributed sensing and access in multichannel CR ad hoc networks where the SUs’ transmission opportunities are commensurate with their sensing contributions, thus fostering cooperation and eliminating free-riders. Numerical results show that the proposed two-layer game is computationally efficient and outperforms previously investigated collaborative sensing and spectrum access approaches in heterogeneous multichannel CR scenarios in terms of energy efficiency, throughput, SU fairness, and complexity. Moreover, it is demonstrated that this game is robust to changes in the network topology and the number of SUs. Finally, a new physical-layer approach is proposed to distribute the network-level miss-detection (MD) constraints fairly among the interfering SUs for guaranteed PU protection and demonstrate the performance advantages of the AND-rule combining of spectrum sensing results for heterogeneous SUs.},

abstract={The coexistence of device-to-device (D2D) and cellular communications in the same band is a promising solution to the dramatic increase of wireless networks traffic load, in particular in the presence of local traffic, when source and destination nodes are in close proximity. In this case, the mobile nodes can communicate in a semi-autonomous way (D2D mode), with minimal or no control by the base station (BS), but they may create a harmful interference to the cellular communications. In order to avoid it, we design a distributed approach that allows the mobile node to acquire in real time local information by observing few channel and topology parameters. Based on this information, each user can infer in advance not only the quality of its transmission, but also its impact on other ongoing surrounding communications towards the BS. This enables a smart, adaptive mode and power selection performed with a network wide perspective. Differently from most approaches, this selection is made autonomously by each D2D sources, with no need for a centralized scheduling. We compare our strategy to the state-of-the-art in the same distributed network scenario, showing the importance of exploiting local information for a dynamic, interference aware power and mode selection.},

abstract={We consider a dynamic multichannel access problem, where multiple correlated channels follow an unknown joint Markov model and users select the channel to transmit data. The objective is to find a policy that maximizes the expected long-term number of successful transmissions. The problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) with unknown system dynamics. To overcome the challenges of unknown dynamics and prohibitive computation, we apply the concept of reinforcement learning and implement a Deep Q-Network (DQN). We first study the optimal policy for fixed-pattern channel switching with known system dynamics and show through simulations that DQN can achieve the same optimal performance without knowing the system statistics. We then compare the performance of DQN with a Myopic policy and a Whittle Index-based heuristic through both more general simulations as well as real data trace and show that DQN achieves near-optimal performance in more complex situations. Finally, we propose an adaptive DQN approach with the capability to adapt its learning in time-varying scenarios.},

pages={1-1},
abstract={Coordinating medium access for a massive number of devices is challenging in general wireless ad hoc networks such as cognitive radio networks and Device-to-Device (D2D) communication networks. To facilitate medium access, it is often desirable to gather some channel side information (CSI) at the transmitter side such as the channel availability in cognitive radio networks and the channel state information in D2D communication networks. In addition, since it is usually costly to gather the CSI for a large number of devices in a centralized way, distributed medium access control becomes attractive, where each user collects its own CSI to support autonomous and scalable data transmission. However, in the literature, there lacks a systematic way to understand the value of such CSI in the overall network performance. Game theory is often a natural choice for modeling the autonomous and strategic behavior of users. In this paper, we first formulate the multi-band random access game and design a polynomial time algorithm to identify the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Then, we propose a systematic framework to incorporate the CSI into the decision making based on the Bayesian game approach. We analyze how the knowledge of the CSI affects the equilibrium strategy and measure the value of this CSI knowledge by the utility difference. We resolve Braess-like paradoxes in general wireless ad hoc networks.},

abstract={Nyquist sampling at very high carriers can be prohibitively costly for low power wireless devices. In spectrum sensing, this limit calls for an analog front-end that can sweep different bands quickly, in order to use the available spectrum opportunistically. In this paper we propose a new sub-Nyquist analog front-end and a sensing strategy formulated as a sequential utility optimization problem. The sensing action maximizes a utility function decreasing linearly with the number of measurements, and increasing as a function of the active spectrum components that are correctly detected. The optimization selects the best linear combinations of sub-bands to mix, in order to accrue maximum utility. The structure of the utility represents the trade-off between exploration, exploitation and risk of making an error, that is characteristic of the spectrum sensing problem. We first present the analog front-end architecture, and then map the measurement model into the abstract optimization problem proposed, and analyzed, in the remainder of the paper. We characterize the optimal policy, under constraints on the sensing matrix, and derive the approximation factor of the greedy approach we introduce to solve the problem. Numerical simulations showcase the benefits of combining active spectrum sensing with sub-Nyquist sampling.},

abstract={In this paper, the joint spectrum sensing and resource allocation problem is investigated in a multi-band-multi-user cognitive radio (CR) network. Assuming imperfect spectrum sensing information, our goal is to jointly optimize the sensing threshold and power allocation strategy such that the average total throughput of secondary users (SUs) is maximized. Additionally, the power of SUs is constrained to keep the interference introduced to primary users (PUs) under certain limits, which gives rise to a nonconvex mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) optimization problem. Our contribution in this paper is threefold. First, it is illustrated that the dimension of the nonconvex MINLP problem can be significantly reduced, which helps to re-formulate the optimization problem without resorting to integer variables. Second, it is demonstrated that the simplified formulation admits the canonical form of a monotonic optimization and an ∈-optimal solution can be achieved using the polyblock outer approximation algorithm. Third, a practical low-complexity spectrum sensing and resource allocation algorithm is developed to reduce the computational cost. Finally, the effectiveness of proposed algorithms is verified by simulations.},

abstract={In this paper, an online reinforcement learning method based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to maximize transmission energy efficiency of cognitive radio sensor networks (CRSN) by regularizing packet lengths. The idea is to simulate a set of artificial channels to find a hypothetical channel that behaves almost equivalently to the actual channel by minimizing a properly developed loss function. This method eliminates the need for a separate offline channel estimation. The results show an improvement of respectively 40% and 20% in the energy efficiency of the proposed method compared to the constant packet length and MLE based offline channel estimation. Also, the PSO based optimization method outperforms similar evolutionary methods. This framework is general and can be used to optimize a desired parameter in cognitive radio networks.},

abstract={In this letter, joint transmission power and bandwidth allocation is investigated for multiple pairs of secondary users in a cognitive underlay system. In the investigated system, the interference channel’s statistics, including mean and variance, may change over time. It is assumed that a limit number of historical measurements of the interference channel’s mean and variance are available. Based on the measurements, a minimum-volume elliptical region is used to describe the uncertainty of the interference channel’s mean and variance. Sum capacity of multiple secondary users is maximized while limiting the worst-case interference outage probability. The worst-case interference outage probability is over the interference channel gain’s distribution, which is subject to the uncertain mean and variance in the elliptical region. An optimization problem is formulated, which is non-convex. The formulated non-convex optimization problem is decomposed into two levels. In each level, only a convex problem is required to be solved. Then the global optimal solution can be achieved. Numerical results are presented to verify the effectiveness of our method.},

abstract={Hardware limitation at the secondary user (SU) terminal makes multiband (wideband) spectrum sensing more challenging. This paper considers spectrum sensing under SU hardware limitation, where a SU can only sense a small portion of the multiband spectrum for a given time period. This introduces a design issue of selecting channels to sense at a given time. A random spectrum sensing strategy (RSSS) is presented to select the subchannels to sense in a totally random fashion. Considering the Markov property of the state transition of a primary user (PU), an adaptive spectrum sensing strategy (ASSS) is then proposed to take advantage of the PU traffic patterns in determining the subchannels to sense. In the proposed ASSS, a novel decision rule is designed and two decision combinations are obtained. The ASSS decision rule adaptively selects a decision combination to determine the subchannels to sense for SU such that the selected subchannels are more likely to be available for the SU network. A metric called spectrum sensing capability (SSC) is defined to evaluate the performance of any spectrum sensing strategies. The SSC expressions for both RSSS and ASSS are derived. Numerical results show significant performance gain of ASSS as compared to RSSS.},

abstract={During cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) in cognitive radio networks (CRN), malicious users (MUs) not only launch spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attack, but also wiretap legitimate users (LUs) during the reporting phase. In this letter, an energy-efficient defensive strategy against hybrid SSDF/eavesdropping attacks is proposed, to achieve both energy-efficiency and physical layer security. Secure CSS reporting/eavesdropping channels are modeled as Nakagami-m fading channels. The optimal MUs and LUs are determined via the achievement of maximum energy-efficiency that is subject to the optimal report bits, report distance as well as report error rate. Furthermore, intercept performance of the proposed strategy in the presence of multiple MUs is also investigated. Simulation results reveal that, the proposed strategy is immune to MU numbers, report distance as well as report error rate. Moreover, the intercept probability can be reduced in multiple MUs scenario when the legitimate-to-malicious ratio (LMR) is high and the channel fading factor ratio is large.},

abstract={Self Organizing Networks (SON) have been deployed, typically with the SON Functions (SFs) as rule-based controllers that evaluate metrics and decide actions based on a set of rules. Atop SFs, SON coordination ensures that the SFs do not conflict with one another during operations. However, as SON evolves towards Cognitive Network Management (CNM), with SFs as cognitive, learning-based agents, called Cognitive Functions (CFs), coordination gets extremely complicated. The coordinator must track the multiple dynamic agents each having non-deterministic behavior owing to the learning. Yet, if smart enough, the agents could also learn to minimize the conflicts or at least the related effects negating need for a coordinator. We present a distributed coordination approach called Synchronized Cooperative Learning (SCL), where CFs learn to minimize their effects on one another. We apply the concept to a network with CFs for Mobility Robustness Optimization and Mobility Load Balancing, with results showing that using this approach, the functions learn to find a good compromise between maximizing individual metrics and minimizing cross effects on their peers.},

abstract={The development of smart cities and their fast-paced deployment is resulting in the generation of large quantities of data at unprecedented rates. Unfortunately, most of the generated data is wasted without extracting potentially useful information and knowledge because of the lack of established mechanisms and standards that benefit from the availability of such data. Moreover, the highly dynamic nature of smart cities calls for a new generation of machine learning approaches that are flexible and adaptable to cope with the dynamicity of data to perform analytics and learn from real-time data. In this article, we shed light on the challenge of underutilizing the big data generated by smart cities from a machine learning perspective. In particular, we present the phenomenon of wasting unlabeled data. We argue that semi-supervision is a must for smart cities to address this challenge. We also propose a three-level learning framework for smart cities that matches the hierarchical nature of big data generated by smart cities with a goal of providing different levels of knowledge abstraction. The proposed framework is scalable to meet the needs of smart city services. Fundamentally, the framework benefits from semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning where a small amount of data that has users' feedback serves as labeled data, while a larger amount without such users' feedback serves as unlabeled data. The framework utilizes a mix of labeled and unlabeled data to converge toward better control policies instead of wasting the unlabeled data. This article also explores how deep reinforcement learning and its shift toward semi-supervision can handle the cognitive side of smart city services and improve their performance by providing several use cases spanning the different domains of smart cities. We also highlight several challenges as well as promising future research directions for incorporating machine learning and high-level intelligence into smart city services.},

abstract={Cooperative spectrum sensing has been studied to combat the hidden terminal problem by exploiting the spatial diversity in cognitive radio (CR) networks. This work concerns blind cooperative spectrum sensing with soft fusion where the a priori knowledge of channels and primary signals is unavailable, and soft information is transmitted from each secondary user (SU) to a fusion center for detection. We first introduce the Quade test to design a blind detector. Then, a new detector with both lower computational complexity and lower overhead is derived, where only the estimated power and the variance of the instantaneous power at each SU are required at the fusion center. The analytical expressions for the detection performance, in terms of false-alarm probability and detection probability, are derived for the proposed detector. Simulation results are provided to validate the theoretical analyses and demonstrate the superior performance of proposed detector compared to the state-of-theart detectors. It is also shown that, with the increase of the number of hidden terminals in the CR, the proposed detector can maintain high detection performance while the conventional detectors exhibit rapid performance degradation.},

abstract={D2D communication and cognitive radio are among the key technologies that can help to solve the bandwidth bottleneck problem of cellular networks. Such technologies help to maintain the necessary communication between user devices in case of natural disasters and traffic hotspot situations. In this paper, we efficiently exploit the relay selection and cooperative beamforming (CBF) strategies for D2D communication and show that user devices can securely communicate with each other without infrastructure support. We propose a cluster-based hierarchical topology for a multi-hop cooperative relay network, to cover the potentially long distance between the source and the destination. The cluster heads in the proposal act as Primary Users (PUs) and the cluster members are regarded as Secondary Users (SUs) or relay nodes. A system model is presented to analyze the problems of relay selection and power allocation in SUs located in different clusters and hierarchical levels. To investigate the efficiency of our proposed model, we define the utilities of PUs employing relay selection and CBF, considering received signal power and latency. We optimize relay selection and beamforming vector by solving a mixed integer non-linear problem (MINLP). Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our approach.},

abstract={This paper studies the problem of spectrum-aware routing in a multi-hop, multi-channel cognitive radio network when malicious nodes in the secondary network attempt to block the path with mixed attacks. Based on the location and timevariant path delay information, we model the path discovery process as a non-cooperative stochastic game. By exploiting the structure of the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP), we decompose the stochastic routing game into a series of stage games. For each stage game, we propose a distributed strategy learning mechanism based on stochastic fictitious play to learn the equilibrium strategies of joint relay-channel selection in the condition of both limited information exchange and potential routing-toward-primary attacks. We also introduce a trustworthiness evaluation mechanism based on a multi-arm bandit process for normal users to avoid relaying to the sinkhole attackers. Simulation results show that without the need of information flooding, the proposed algorithm is efficient in bypassing the malicious nodes with mixed attacks.},

abstract={We consider a cognitive radio network with single antenna primary user (PU), destination and eavesdropper, and multi-antenna secondary users (SUs). SUs act as helper nodes transmitting noise to confound a passive eavesdropper while nulling the interference leakage at the destination. The jamming helper nodes are non-altruistic, and they gain access to the primary network by aiding in the confidential transmissions of the PU. We obtain the secrecy outage probability as a closed-form expression when PU and SUs have merely statistical information about the eavesdropper channel. For the delay-unlimited system, we derive the achievable confidential rates given the control strategies for bandwidth and power allocation. For the more practical delay-limited case, we formulate a network control problem with secrecy appearing as a Quality of Service (QoS) constraint optimizing the confidential and open transmission rates of the PU and SUs respectively. Finally, we develop a dynamic control algorithm obtaining asymptotically optimal solution and demonstrate its performance by numerical experiments.},

abstract={Dynamic spectrum sharing will facilitate the interference coordination in device-to-device (D2D) communications. In the absence of network level coordination, the timing synchronization among D2D users will be unavailable, leading to inaccurate channel state estimation and device detection, especially in time-varying fading environments. In this study, we design an asynchronous device detection/discovery framework for cognitive-D2D applications, which acquires timing drifts and dynamical fading channels when directly detecting the existence of a proximity D2D device (e.g. or primary user). To model and analyze this, a new dynamical system model is established, where the unknown timing deviation follows a random process, while the fading channel is governed by a discrete state Markov chain. To cope with the mixed estimation and detection (MED) problem, a novel sequential estimation scheme is proposed, using the conceptions of statistic Bayesian inference and random finite set. By tracking the unknown states (i.e. varying time deviations and fading gains) and suppressing the link uncertainty, the proposed scheme can effectively enhance the detection performance. The general framework, as a complimentary to a network-aided case with the coordinated signaling, provides the foundation for development of flexible D2D communications along with proximity-based spectrum sharing.},

abstract={In this paper, we study distributed power allocation for multi-flow carrier aggregation (MFCA) in cognitive cellular networks. Our approach differs from the conventional water filling (WF) algorithm since we deal with the heterogeneous fading channels, wherein all of the Lagrange multipliers are not handled equally over the heterogeneous cells. The distributed power control solution is carried out over the heterogeneous fading channels that are considered non-identically distributed and non-identical Nakagami- $m$ fading channels. We first formulate the optimization problem and we next solve it using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which allows the required decomposition for each channel and required statistical learning among the different sub-problem solutions.We also provide comparison with dual decomposition method (DDM) and WF solutions considered as solutions without cognition. Simulation results highlight the performance gain of ADMM in terms of number of iterations. Further, we provide a multiuser application scenario, where the analysis on the new fading channel model for Nakagami- $m$ channels is carried out. We distinguish into the synchronous and the asynchronous ADMM implementations tackling with the asynchronous user updates that can be found in an heterogeneous network deployment. The simulation results are obtained to highlight the impact of the partial barrier and the bounded delay in the asynchronous use case.},

A new optimization framework is proposed in order to select the maximum number of SUs and compute power allocations in order to satisfy instantaneous rate or QoS requirements of SUs. The optimization framework also aims to restrict the interference to primary users (PUs) below a predefined threshold using available imperfect CSI at the SBS. In order to obtain a feasible solution for power allocation and user selection, we propose a low-complexity algorithm called Delete-su-with-Maximum-Power-allocation (DMP). Theoretical analysis is provided to compute the interference to PUs and the number of SUs exceeding the required rate. The analysis and simulations show that the proposed DMP algorithm outperforms the state-of-the art selection algorithm in terms of serving more users with minimum rate constraints, and it approaches the optimal solution if the number of antennas is an order of magnitude greater than the number of users.},

abstract={By enabling sensor nodes to opportunistically access licensed channels, CRSN can provide a spectrum-efficient networking solution in the era of the Internet of Things. On the other hand, it also consumes extra energy for spectrum sensing and switching. This is a double-edged sword posing a dilemma between spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency. Recent advances in RF energy harvesting and transfer promote RF-powered CRSN in providing a promising way to address this challenge. In RF-powered CRSNs, sensor nodes can dynamically access the vacant licensed channels for interference-free data transmission and can also utilize the strong signals over the occupied licensed channels for energy harvesting. In this article, we investigate RF energy harvesting and transfer in CRSNs. We first introduce the architecture and advantages of RF-powered CRSN, typical applications, as well as the key challenges arising from applying RF energy harvesting and transfer into CRSN. We then propose a resource allocation framework to demonstrate how to jointly control the dynamic channel access and energy management to optimize network utility while guaranteeing network stability and sustainability. Some future directions are finally envisioned for further research.},

Autonomic networking calls for automated decisions for management actions. This can be realized through a set of pre-defined network management policies engineered from human expert knowledge. However, engineering sufficiently accurate knowledge considering the high complexity of today's networking environment is a difficult task. This has been a particularly limiting factor in the practical deployment of autonomic systems. ML is a powerful technique for extracting knowledge from data. However, there has been little evidence of its application in realizing practical management solutions for autonomic networks. Recent advances in network softwarization and programmability through SDN and NFV, the proliferation of new sources of data, and the availability of lowcost and seemingly infinite storage and compute resource from the cloud are paving the way for the adoption of ML to realize cognitive network management in support of autonomic networking.

title={Network Resource Allocation via Stochastic Subgradient Descent: Convergence Rate},
year={2018},
volume={PP},
number={99},
pages={1-1},
abstract={This paper considers a general stochastic resource allocation problem that arises widely in wireless networks, cognitive radio, networks, smart-grid communications, and crosslayer design. The problem formulation involves expectations with respect to a collection of random variables with unknown distributions, representing exogenous quantities such as channel gain, user density, or spectrum occupancy. We consider the constant step-size stochastic dual subgradient descent (SDSD) method that has been widely used for online resource allocation in networks. The problem is solved in dual domain which results in a primal resource allocation subproblem at each time instant. The goal here is to characterize the non-asymptotic behavior of such stochastic resource allocations in an almost sure sense. It is well known that with a step size of ϵ, SDSD converges to an O(ϵ)-sized neighborhood of the optimum. In practice however, there exists a trade-off between the rate of convergence and the choice of ϵ. This paper establishes a convergence rate result for the SDSD algorithm that precisely characterizes this trade-off. Towards this end, a novel stochastic bound on the gap between the objective function and the optimum is developed. The asymptotic behavior of the stochastic term is characterized in an almost sure sense, thereby generalizing the existing results for the stochastic subgradient methods. For the stochastic resource allocation problem at hand, the result explicates the rate with which the allocated resources become near-optimal. As an application, the power and user-allocation problem in device-to-device networks is formulated and solved using the SDSD algorithm. Further intuition on the rate results is obtained from the verification of the regularity conditions and accompanying simulation results.},

abstract={New communication standards need to deal with machine-to-machine communications, in which users may start or stop transmitting at any time in an asynchronous manner. Thus, the number of users is an unknown and time-varying parameter that needs to be accurately estimated in order to properly recover the symbols transmitted by all users in the system. In this paper, we address the problem of joint channel parameter and data estimation in a multiuser communication channel in which the number of transmitters is not known. For that purpose, we develop the infinite factorial finite state machine model, a Bayesian nonparametric model based on the Markov Indian buffet that allows for an unbounded number of transmitters with arbitrary channel length. We propose an inference algorithm that makes use of slice sampling and particle Gibbs with ancestor sampling. Our approach is fully blind as it does not require a prior channel estimation step, prior knowledge of the number of transmitters, or any signaling information. Our experimental results, loosely based on the LTE random access channel, show that the proposed approach can effectively recover the data-generating process for a wide range of scenarios, with varying number of transmitters, number of receivers, constellation order, channel length, and signal-to-noise ratio.},

Although the use of SDN simplifies the WMN management, it is still not clear whether the SDN architecture, which was originally designed for wired links, can effectively handle the dynamic topology of WMNs. This paper addresses the traffic balancing issue introduced by node mobility. To reduce the response time of SDN controller for dynamic network topology, a two-layer supervised learning model is proposed that helps the controller to predict the node mobility and link failure probability. Then, an alternative route selection scheme is proposed, which achieves optimal traffic balancing while minimizing the control plane overhead. Efficiency of the proposed SD-WMN architecture is validated in the widely used network simulator -ns-3. Our results demonstrate the network throughput enhancement achieved by the proposed SD-WMN architecture with link-failure adaptive traffic control.},

abstract={The problem of signal detection and modulation recognition is addressed in both the blind and nonblind contexts. Many relevant modulation recognition algorithms have been created over the past three decades. The essential engineering trade-off that fuels the algorithm-invention process is between generality and optimality. Optimal (for example, maximum-likelihood) algorithms can be devised for narrow subsets of signal types, whereas highly general but suboptimal feature-based algorithms can be devised for wide subsets of types. It has previously been shown that cyclostationary-based classifiers possess highly desirable properties, such as tolerance to noise and cochannel interference, but also that they are computational costly and so are resistant to real-time hardware implementation. In this paper, we present a reduced-complexity method of signal detection and modulation recognition that exploits the cyclostationarity of over-the-air observed communication signals. The key idea is to represent wideband input data as a set of narrowband, contiguous, nonoverlapping subchannels, and then to extract the desired cyclostationary features for the wideband data using only sparse subsets of the subchannels.},

abstract={Hadamard ratio detector (HRD) has been used for spectrum sensing scenarios with uncalibrated receivers in cognitive radios. In literature, the theoretical analysis for the probability of false-alarm and the decision threshold was carried out under the asymptotic conditions. Therefore, the obtained results were theoretically valid only when the number of receivers is small but the number of samples is very large. In this letter, we focus on the HRD in non-asymptotic scenarios with relatively small samples. A new analytical expression for the probability of false-alarm is firstly derived by using the cumulant generating function (CGF) method. Based on this, a computationally efficient method for determining the decision threshold is also provided. Simulation results validate the theoretical analysis.},

abstract={In this letter, two families of asynchronous-symmetric channel-hopping (CH) sequences over prime field are constructed. With straightforward construction algorithms, they provide a flexible balance between adjustable cardinality, full degree-of-rendezvous, and short maximum-time-to-rendezvous (MTTR) for practical cognitive radio networks. These CH sequences have smaller rendezvous-success-rate variance than their counterparts, thus supporting a more stable and uniform rendezvous process. As secondary users cannot transmit in channels occupied by primary (licensed) users, the average MTTR of these CH sequences is analyzed under a random channel-replacement method.},

abstract={Link stability significantly suffers from dynamical primary user activities and random node movement in mobile cognitive networks (MCNs). In multihop MCNs, it will become even worse due to potential interference among multiple links so that stable routing will become more important and also more challenging than that in traditional wireless networks. In this paper, we first formulate the joint topology control and stable routing (JTCSR) problem based on primary user (PU) activity prediction. Then, we propose a PU prediction model to reveal channel utilization patterns of PUs. Next, we propose a novel routing metric PU prediction-based stability metric (PPSM), which quantitatively measures PU activities and node mobility, and design a min–max PPSM matrix construction algorithm. Finally, we propose and develop a PU prediction-based (PP) JTCSR algorithm for maximizing network throughput, which can find out the most stable and the shortest path. Theoretical analysis validates the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. NS2-based simulation results further demonstrate that our PP-JTCSR can generate stable and efficient topology through predicting PU activities quantitatively, and outperforms related proposals in terms of path stability, average throughput, and packet loss rate.},

abstract={This paper explores joint power allocation and route selection in a multihop cognitive radio network consisting of secondary transmitter and receiver connected through decode-and-forward relays. A novel frame structure of radio frequency energy harvesting (EH)-cooperation-transmission is considered that operates in time switching mode. The relays also help (cooperation phase) in data transmission between the primary transmitter and receiver using a fraction of the harvested energy. An optimization problem is formulated to minimize the end-to-end secondary outage probability under the constraints of energy causality and primary user cooperation rate. Closed form expressions of the optimal time duration for EH and power allocation factor on each relay are also derived. In order to minimize the total power consumption (cost) and to enhance the network lifetime, the optimal route selection is also explored using Bellman-Ford algorithm and the efficacy of the same over Dijkstra’s algorithm is also demonstrated by a large set of simulation results. Simulation results also show that a gain in outage probability ~43.57% and ~56.66% is achieved for the proposed approach over the existing works.},

abstract={The rapid growth of video traffic in cellular networks is a crucial issue to be addressed by mobile operators. An emerging and promising trend in this regard is the development of solutions that aim at maximizing the quality of experience (QoE) of the end users. However, predicting the QoE perceived by the users in different conditions remains a major challenge. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to support QoE-based video admission control and resource management algorithms. More specifically, we develop a multi-stage learning system that combines the unsupervised learning of video features from the size of H.264-encoded video frames with a supervised classifier trained to automatically extract the quality-rate characteristics of unknown video sequences. This QoE characterization is then used to manage simultaneous video transmissions through a shared channel in order to guarantee a minimum quality level delivered to the final users. Simulation results show that the proposed video admission control and resource management algorithms, which are based on learning-based QoE classification of video sequences, outperform standard content-agnostic strategies.},

title={Efficient Time Domain Deterministic-Stochastic Model of Spectrum Usage},

volume={17},
number={3},
pages={1518-1527},
abstract={For achieving an efficient spectrum sharing in a context of dynamic spectrum access, understanding the spectrum usage by licensed users [primary users (PUs)], is important for secondary users (SUs). Duty cycle (DC) has been used to express the deterministic and stochastic aspects of spectrum usage. Specifically, a deterministic model for the mean of the duty cycle (M-DC) has been proposed in a previous work. The deterministic aspect of M-DC is affected by social behavior, and common habits of users, which can be confirmed in cellular systems. On the other hand, the observed DC (O-DC) during short time duration has randomness and a stochastic model is more suitable, e.g. distribution of O-DC. In this paper, we extend the conventional approach, in which only either the deterministic or stochastic aspect is considered, to a combined deterministic-stochastic (DS) model, which represents both the deterministic and stochastic aspects at once. For the distribution of the O-DC, the beta distribution has been used as stochastic model, but we employ a mixture of beta distributions. The mixture-beta distribution can achieve higher accuracy but requires more capacity for data storage in spectrum usage measurements since it has a higher number of parameters than the beta distribution. For this issue, we employ regression analysis in DS-model since this approach can reduce the number of parameters while retaining the accuracy. We show the validity of DS-model based on exhaustive spectrum measurements in IEEE 802.11-based wireless local area networks and long-term evolution uplink.},

title={A New Probabilistic Target Channel Selection Approach for Load Balancing in Cognitive Radio Networks},
year={2018},
volume={4},
number={1},
pages={43-52},
abstract={Cognitive radio is a technology targeting better utilization for the available frequency bands by allowing the unlicensed secondary users (SUs) to access the licensed frequency bands of the primary users (PUs). The SU vacates the channel at the presence of the PU and selects a target channel reactively or proactively to complete his interrupted transmission. Target channel sequence order can greatly affect the performance of the network in terms of delay, capacity, and utilization. The probabilistic sequence target channel selection approach was shown to distribute the load smoothly among the available channels resulting in good load balancing characteristics and increasing network capacity and stability for an appropriate distribution function. In this paper, a new proactive probabilistic sequence approach to determine the target channel for the interrupted SUs is proposed to achieve load balancing. The pre-emptive resume priority M/M/1 queueing network model is used to analyse the proposed approach to evaluate the latency and load balancing performance. Moreover, a new quantitative performance measure for balancing is introduced. The proposed approach is compared to other alternative spectrum handoff strategies and numerical results show the advantage of the proposed probabilistic sequence approach by improving balancing and channel capacity. Moreover, the extended data delivery time is improved at low network loads.},

pages={1269-1282},
abstract={In this paper, the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology is integrated into cognitive orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, called cognitive OFDM-NOMA, to boost the system capacity. First, a capacity maximization problem is considered in half-duplex cognitive OFDM-NOMA systems with two accessible users on each subcarrier. Due to the intractability of the considered problem, we decompose it into three subproblems, i.e., the optimization of, respectively, sensing duration, user scheduling, and power allocation. By investigating and exploiting the characteristics of each subproblem, the optimal sensing duration adaptation, a matching-theory-based user scheduling, and the optimal power allocation are proposed correspondingly. An alternate iteration framework is further proposed to jointly optimize these three subproblems, with its convergence proved. Moreover, based on the non-cooperative game theory, a generalized power allocation algorithm is proposed and then used in the framework to accommodate half-duplex cognitive OFDM-NOMA systems with multiple users on each subcarrier. Finally, the proposed framework is extended to solve the capacity maximization problem in full-duplex cognitive OFDM-NOMA systems. Simulation results validate the superior performance of the proposed algorithms. For example, for the case of two accessible users, the proposed framework approaches the optimal solution with less than 1% capacity loss and 120 times lower complexity compared with exhaustive search.},

abstract={Hybrid interweave-underlay spectrum access in cognitive radio networks can explore spectrum opportunities when primary users (PUs) are either active or inactive, which significantly improves spectrum utilization. The practical wireless systems, such as long-term evolution-advanced, usually operate at multiple transmission power levels, leading to a multiple primary transmission power scenario. In such a case, the two fundamental issues in hybrid interweave-underlay spectrum access are to detect the “ON/OFF” status of PUs and to recognize the operating power level of PUs, which are challenging due to non-Gaussian transmitted signals. In this paper, we exploit high-order cumulants (HOCs) to efficiently perform spectrum sensing and power recognition. Specifically, for a given order and time lag, we first propose a single HOC-based spectrum sensing and power recognition scheme with low computational complexity, by leveraging minimum Bayes risk criterion. Moreover, we propose a hybrid multiple HOCs-based spectrum sensing and power recognition scheme with multiple orders and time lags, to further improve the detection performance. Both the proposed schemes can eliminate the adverse impact of the noise power uncertainty. Finally, simulation results are provided to evaluate the proposed schemes.},

abstract={We explore the application of simultaneous sensing and reception (SSR) for cognitive communication in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based wireless systems such as 3GPP LTE-A which may find application in multi-tier spectrum sharing paradigms such as the spectrum access system. In such a system, a cognitive radio (CR) synchronized to the macro base station (BS) is assumed to exploit the spectral holes in the OFDMA time-frequency grid. We analyze the impact of timing alignment in such a system and show that power control and guard bands are essential to support such an operation. Practical algorithms for SSR with the constant false alarm rate property are developed using the generalized likelihood ratio test principle to protect macro BS users occupying the same transmission resources as the CRs. Subsequently, we propose a transmission-reception protocol with SSR for bidirectional communication between two time-division duplex CRs and compare it to a protocol with only sensing before transmission (SBT). The simulation results show that the sensing overhead in traditional SBT protocols can be much reduced with the use of SSR when the BS activity in adjacent slots is highly correlated.},

volume={4},
number={1},
pages={1-14},
abstract={The tradeoff between decreasing the interference to primary user (PU) and increasing secondary users’ (SUs’) achievable throughput is an important problem in cognitive radio networks. Heterogeneous fading channels from PU to multiple SUs, PU’s traffic distribution, limited SU’s power and multiple SUs’ access contention impact both these two conflicting objectives. In this paper, we study the joint impact of these four factors on the tradeoff. More specifically, we consider that the channels from PU to SUs are exposed to non-identically independent free space path losses, PU’s traffic randomly arrives and departs from the channel, every SU’s average power consumption is limited, while multiple SUs contend to transmit. We first model the impact of these factors on SUs’ spectrum sensing and data transmission. Then, we formulate the tradeoff aiming at maximizing SUs’ aggregated throughput under two constraints: 1) interference probability to PU and 2) SUs’ average power consumption. To solve the optimization problem, we design a novel cluster based particle swarm optimization (C-PSO) algorithm. By iteratively updating the particles in a cluster based on the comparison of their fitnesses, the cluster converges to the optimal solution rapidly. Simulation results validate the feasibility of the C-PSO algorithm and the outperformance of our proposal compared against related contributions which consider the homogeneous fading channel. They also show how the optimal solution varies with path losses and PU’s traffic distribution.},

abstract={This paper proposes prediction-and-sensing-based spectrum sharing, a new spectrum-sharing model for cognitive radio networks, with a time structure for each resource block divided into a spectrum prediction-and-sensing phase and a data transmission phase. Cooperative spectrum prediction is incorporated as a sub-phase of spectrum sensing in the first phase. We investigate a joint design of transmit beamforming at the secondary base station (BS) and sensing time. The primary design goal is to maximize the sum rate of all secondary users (SUs) subject to the minimum rate requirement for all SUs, the transmit power constraint at the secondary BS, and the interference power constraints at all primary users. The original problem is difficult to solve since it is highly nonconvex. We first convert the problem into a more tractable form, then arrive at a convex program based on an inner approximation framework, and finally propose a new algorithm to successively solve this convex program. We prove that the proposed algorithm iteratively improves the objective while guaranteeing convergence at least to local optima. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reaches a stationary point after only a few iterations with a substantial performance improvement over existing approaches.},

abstract={Using a novel embedded Markov chain, we model and analyze a cognitive radio performing full-duplex spectrum sensing which is being carried out imperfectly-i.e., with errors-and asynchronously with primary traffic, from the perspective of energy efficiency. The effect of sensing frequency, which is varied by inserting sleeping periods between sensing processes is investigated, with focus on: 1) the energy efficiency of the device measured in terms of the number of successful transmissions under a limited battery budget; 2) the average throughput; and 3) the collision with the primary's traffic. We show analytically that, given false-alarm and mis-detection probabilities, the device's operation in lower-than-maximum sensing frequency may be more energy-efficient than that in maximum-frequency sensing case, while the radio is neither suffering throughput degradation nor disturbing the primary traffic seriously. We validate the deployment of such full-duplex cognitive radio (FDCR) along with the proposed sensing scheme for low-power short-range applications like wireless machine-to-machine communications and sensor networks, where the share of sensing power is comparable to that of transmission power. The merits of the proposed FDCR scheme are demonstrated through comparisons with a half-duplex cognitive radio scheme under different operating conditions and full-duplex self-interference cancellation factors.},

year={2018},
volume={17},

pages={882-898},
abstract={Providing channel access opportunities for new service requests and guaranteeing continuous connections for ongoing flows until service completion are two challenges for service provisioning in wireless networks. Channel failures, which are typically caused by hardware and software failures or/and by intrinsic instability in radio transmissions, can easily result in network performance degradation. In cognitive radio networks (CRNs), secondary transmissions are inherently vulnerable to connection breaks due to licensed users' arrivals as well as channel failures. To explore the advantages of channel reservation on performance improvement in error-prone channels, we propose and analyze a dynamic channel reservation (DCR) algorithm and a dynamic spectrum access (DSA) scheme with three access privilege variations. The key idea of the DCR algorithm is to reserve a dynamically adjustable number of channels for the interrupted services to maintain service retainability for ongoing users or to enhance channel availability for new users. Furthermore, the DCR algorithm is embedded in the DSA scheme enabling spectrum access of primary and secondary users with different access privileges based on access flexibility for licensed shared access. The performance of such a CRN in the presence of homogeneous and heterogeneous channel failures is investigated considering different channel failure and repair rates.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a robust optimal resource allocation (RA) with joint carrier aggregation (CA) approach to allocate multiple carriers resources optimally among users with elastic and inelastic traffic in cellular networks. We use utility proportional fairness allocation policy, where the fairness among users is in utility percentage of the application running on the user equipment (UE). We introduce an efficient RA approach to allocate the network spectrum resources from multiple carriers based on a CA scenario. We present a robust RA algorithm that allocates optimal aggregated rates for both high-traffic and low-traffic situations. Our distributed RA algorithm allocates an optimal rate to each user from all carriers in its range while providing the minimum price for the allocated rate. In addition, we analyze the convergence of the algorithm with different network traffic densities and show that our algorithm provides traffic dependent pricing for network providers. Finally, we present simulation results for the performance of our RA algorithm.},

year={2018},

pages={30-42},
abstract={A novel spectrum handoff scheme, called feature stacking (FEAST) is proposed to achieve the optimal “channel + beam” handoff (CBH) control in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) with multi-beam smart antennas. FEAST uses the online supervised learning based on the support vector machine to maximize the long-term quality of experience of user data. The spectrum handoff uses the mixed preemptive/non-preemptive M/G/1 queueing model with a discretion rule in each beam to overcome the interruptions from the primary users and to resolve the channel contentions among different classes of secondary users (SUs). A real-time CBH scheme is designed to allow the packets in an interrupted beam of a SU to be detoured through its neighboring beams, depending their available capacity and queue sizes. The proposed scheme adapts to the dynamic channel conditions and performs spectrum decision in time- and space-varying CRN conditions. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CBH-based packet detouring scheme, and show that the proposed FEAST-based spectrum decision can adapt to the complex channel conditions and improves the quality of real-time data transmissions compared to the conventional spectrum handoff schemes.},

pages={121-134},
abstract={The deceiving attacker is a radio jammer, equipped with a cognitive radio (CR) platform, which senses the frequency spectrum and launches jamming actions to block, mask, or emulate the legitimate active wireless connections. Using the IEEE 802.22 CR network (CRN) as a basis, this paper proposes a set of deception-based defense strategies to protect the CRNs from the deceiving attack. The Stackelberg framework is adopted in the formulation of the security problem to account for the attacker’s reconnaissance capabilities. To this end, the Stackelberg equilibria between the attacker(s) and the defending CRs are calculated under the two cases when the attacker(s) and the defending CRs know and are uncertain about the primary user activity. The backward induction method is used to calculate the points of SE in the formulated security game. Both theoretical analysis and numerical results show that the defending CRs can decrease the probability of success of the deceiving attack to nearly 0% when the CRs have the incentive to defend the frequency channel(s).},

pages={66-81},
abstract={We consider a two-hop underlay cognitive relay network with an energy harvesting (EH) relay. A simple improved time-switching protocol is proposed in which energy is transmitted in subslots until the relay node is sufficiently charged. The number of charging energy subslots required is fed back to the source by the relay node after the first energy subslot. We demonstrate that the proposed EH transmission scheme can yield better secondary throughput performance as compared to that achieved by an optimal EH transmission protocol using a fixed charging duration, while at the same time eliminating the need for feedback of channel estimates. We first analyze throughput when the source does not possess first-hop channel knowledge, but the relay possesses second hop channel knowledge. We then analyze throughput performance in the important case when the second hop channel estimate is in error, or the practical case when this channel estimate is not available. We show that when the second hop channel estimate is poor, it might be beneficial to use knowledge of only its statistical value. We show that the proposed scheme is energy efficient in terms of energy required per transmitted bit. Computer simulation results validate the derived expressions.},

abstract={We consider the problem of estimating an RF-device’s location based on observations, such as received signal strength, from a set of transmitters with known locations. We survey the literature on this problem, showing that previous authors have considered implicitly or explicitly various metrics. We present a Bayesian optimization framework that unifies these works and shows how to optimize the location estimation with respect to a given metric. We demonstrate how the framework can incorporate a general class of algorithms, including both model-based methods and data-driven algorithms such fingerprinting. This is illustrated by re-deriving the most popular algorithms within this framework. Furthermore, we propose using the error-CDF as a unified way of comparing algorithms based on two methods: 1) stochastic dominance and 2) an upper bound on error-CDFs. We prove that an algorithm that optimizes any distance-based cost function is not strictly stochastically dominated by any other algorithm. This suggests that in lieu of the search for a universally best localization algorithm, the community should focus on finding the best algorithm for a given well-defined objective.},

abstract={The explosive growth of mobile data traffic and the scarcity of available licensed spectrum make resource allocation in heterogeneous networks a critical issue. A distributed resource allocation algorithm for software defined cellular networks for future 5G networks is proposed. The adoption of integrated femto-WiFi small cells is used to alleviate spectrum shortage, by permitting simultaneous access to both the licensed bands (via cellular interface) and unlicensed bands (via WiFi interface). A weighted utility maximization problem is formulated to optimize resource allocation, utilizing the software defined network controller's global view. A fully distributed solution based on the weighted utility maximization optimizes resource allocation, keeping the interference from small cells to macrocells below predefined thresholds. The proposed algorithm considers the sDevices, which have both cellular and WiFi interfaces, and the wDevices which have WiFi-only interfaces. Numerical simulations substantiate the superiority of the proposed resource allocation algorithm, which increases significantly the average throughput and average utility of all devices, compared with the traditional and current methods. Throughput gains as large as 41.6% in spectral efficiency for the average of all sDevices and wDevices are achieved by the new designs.},

abstract={In this paper, we study the performance of a cluster-based multihop underlay cognitive radio network using an ad-hoc routing protocol (called max-link-selection protocol) with decode-and-forward relays over Rayleigh fading channels. Both peak-power and peak-interference constraints are considered in the system. At first, the end-to-end exact and asymptotic outage probabilities of the considered system are derived. By using the derived asymptotic outage, an approximate expression for the optimum number of hops that minimize the outage probability is derived for fixed-rate and fixed-distance between the source and destination nodes. Later, the exact and asymptotic expressions are derived for end-to-end symbol-error-rate (SER) and ergodic-rate of the considered system. Numerical results are presented to validate the derived analytical expressions. It is shown by analysis that with increasing number of relaying hops between the source and destination, the SER performance improves but the ergodic-rate declines.},

These problems are addressed by a proposed sequential solution framework where at each step a large-scale linear program with a large number of variables is required to be solved. To efficiently solve the large-scale program, an accelerated column generation based method is proposed. In the proposed method, an efficient greedy initialization algorithm is first put forward by exploiting the proposed solution structure. After that, both upper and lower bounds on the optimal objective function of each optimization problem are derived, which are used to significantly alleviate the dependence of the whole solution procedure on deriving optimality of problems.

abstract={A cooperative cognitive radio network (CRN) with improved energy detection-based spectrum sensing is analyzed in various fading scenarios. Generalized multipath (Nakagami- $m$ ) fading and enriched multipath (Nakagami- $q$ ) fading models are considered along with two other general fading distributions, i.e., $kappa$ - $mu$ and $eta$ - $mu$ distributions. For spectrum sensing, instead of conventional power 2-based detection method, the arbitrary power $p$ -based improved energy detector is used. The impact of the cognitive user mobility on the performance of the improved energy detector is investigated. Specifically, the statistics for the received signal are derived over various fading environments. The performance of the considered CRN system is evaluated in terms of probability of false alarm, probability of missed detection, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. Moreover, the area under the ROC curve is also obtained. Simulation results are provided to corroborate the theoretical results derived in this paper.},

abstract={Wideband spectrum sensing techniques determine which portions of a given spectrum band are occupied or idle in the frequency domain. The idle portions represent spectrum holes that can potentially be exploited by secondary or unlicensed users. Existing methods for wideband sensing, however, do not take into account the temporal activity of the primary or licensed users within the spectrum band. We propose an algorithm that identifies primary user activity over a wide spectrum band and provides a statistical characterization of the primary user signals in the band. The algorithm applies hidden Markov modeling to a hierarchically partitioned representation of the spectrum band, together with a recursive tree search. Different from existing wideband sensing algorithms, the proposed wideband temporal sensing method is able to accurately detect spectrum holes even in the presence of bursting primary user signals. Moreover, the hidden Markov modeling of the primary user signals enables the accurate detection and the prediction of primary user activity over time. Numerical results demonstrate the significant performance gain of the proposed algorithm over existing wideband spectrum sensing algorithms, particularly in the presence of low duty-cycle primary user signals.},

abstract={Several spectrum sensing methods have been introduced to detect spectrum holes in the radio spectrum. Each method has its own strengths and limitations. No single spectrum sensing method works well in all scenarios. Since spectrum sensing is the key enabler in cognitive radio, it should be capable of reliably detecting the presence or absence of primary users. In this paper, we present a hybrid spectrum sensing architecture which combines the advantages of energy detection, autocorrelation based detection and covariance absolute value method (CAV). Based on the availability of information about the received signal and its correlation strength, one of the three methods is used for detection. The sensing time is increased since it has to decide on one among the three techniques. A methodology for deciding the most suitable technique is also proposed. The proposed hybrid architecture has been implemented on Xilinx Virtex 5 board (XC5VLX110T) and the results have been compared with those of the individual methods.},

However, channel allocation to the CR users without degradation of the Quality of Service (QoS) of the Primary Users (PU) is a significant problem. In this work, a Cognitive Channel Allocation Algorithm is proposed for a CRN where two homogeneous buffers have been considered. Continuous Time Markov Chain is used to model the system. It is observed that introduction of buffers improve the QoS of both handoff calls and new calls of the CR users. Improvement of over 12% in CU and about 40% in the call blocking probability has been observed which ensures satisfactory QoS of the CR users.},

abstract={The efficient spectrum utilization in the modern era has become the most important aspect because most of the licensed users underutilize the spectrum available. However, this cannot be compromised with the freedom of the licensed user. In this paper, an efficient algorithm, Efficient Interference Mitigation algorithm using CoOperative Localization (EIMCOL) has been proposed to reduce the interference at the primary receiver caused due to the cognitive users. In this proposed algorithm, cooperative localization technique like trilateration is used to find the coordinates of the primary users assuming the positions of the cognitive users are already known. The distance between the primary receiver and the secondary transmitter based on the localized coordinates is compared with the transmission range of the secondary transmitter. When the distance between the primary receiver and secondary transmitter is less than the transmission range of the secondary transmitter, the power of the secondary transmitter is adaptively varied to mitigate the interference of the primary user. In this algorithm, RSS information is also used to adjust the secondary transmitter power. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides better capacity and EVM reduction than the existing algorithms.},

abstract={Development of smart spectrum sensing techniques is the most important task in the design of a cognitive radio system which uses the available spectrum efficiently. The adaptive SNR estimation based energy detection technique has the dual benefit of improving the efficiency of spectrum usage by capitalizing on the underutilization of the spectrum in an adaptive and iterative fashion, as well as reducing the hardware resources leading to easy implementation on a versatile and diverse group of cognitive radio infrastructures. The use of adaptive threshold for energy detection based on SNR estimation improves the spectrum sensing performance and efficiency of the cognitive radio by many folds, especially in low SNR as well as high noise variance situations. The proposed method is implemented on the USRP B200 and results show significant improvement in the detection rate of primary users as compared to conventional energy detection techniques.},

abstract={Cognitive radio intelligently adapts particular transmission or reception parameter by sensing the environment. It had taken strong consideration currently for its capability to enhance spectrum efficiency by enabling secondary users to use the spectrum resource, when it is being unused by primary user. In a multiuser cognitive radio system, the coverage region of a secondary system is divided into overlay and hybrid region. The localization of primary system and optimization of resource allocation of secondary system in a multiuser cognitive system is a difficult task. The location of primary system with respect to the secondary system is estimated by using the conventional method and then formulated a resource allocation framework to optimize the overall resource consumption by enhancing the quality of service of a primary system. Simulation result shows that the need for position statistics as a portion of resource allocation and evaluated the proposed method in terms of energy efficiency of the system.},

abstract={Cognitive radio (CR) intelligently adapts particular transmission or reception parameter by sensing the environment. It has received great attention recently for its ability to improve spectrum efficiency by enabling secondary users to access spectrum resource, when it is being unoccupied by primary users. In this paper, spatial modulation technique is employed in overlay cognitive radio networks, in which the primary and secondary networks share the same spectrum band. In CR system model, the direct link between the primary transmitter and receiver is not available along with the Cognitive Radio transmitter assists the primary network as a relay to Decode-and-forward (DF) the transmitted symbols of the primary. Spatial modulation is used in the secondary transmitter to split the transmission space into two data in spatial domains. The secondary transmitter retransmits the primary symbols, while its own information is transmitted by the index of transmitting antenna, similar to space shift keying, without causing any interference to the primary receiver. Outage probability of the spatial modulation in cognitive radio networks is improved by using Transmit Antenna Selection (TAS) at the cognitive transmitter and Maximal Ratio Combiner (MRC) at the primary destination and cognitive destination. A closed form of outage probability expression is derived for primary and secondary destinations. Analytical simulations are also carried out in MATLAB software.},

abstract={Cognitive radio intelligently adapts particular transmission or reception parameter by sensing the environment. It has got an extraordinary consideration to enhance spectrum usage. Spectrum efficiency is increased by enabling secondary users to access spectrum resource, when it is not being occupied by primary users. Cognitive radio vehicular networks are formed for the efficient use of the licensed spectrum for high-bandwidth vehicular informing, driver-help capacities, and traveler amusement administrations. In CR vehicular systems, spectrum information is refreshed by the CR empowered vehicles to maintain the spectrum information is relevant to the current position of the vehicle. The vehicle should finish the information exchanges with roadside base stations (BSs) in short collaboration times to discover the PUs activity since the vehicles have high mobility. By using interference alignment, the message transmission time between BSs and CR vehicles is reduced. The messages are transmitted in fewer time slots. Power consumption is a major problem in communications. In this paper the power consumption is reduced by using an energy-efficient distributed opportunistic interference alignment (OIA) scheme. By using this method the throughput gets increased when compared to the conventional interference alignment (OIA) method.},

abstract={Cognitive Radio (CR) Networks is one of the most powerful emerging areas of wireless networks and communications that provide high-speed and low-cost communications for the end users by incorporating the approved but vacant frequency bands speculatively. These networks exploit underutilized spectrum in dynamically changing environments, where non-licensed secondary users can ‘borrow’ idle spectrum from the primary one's, who hold the license without causing harmful interference. Over the last decade, researchers proposed several multicast routing protocols for cognitive radio ad-hoc network (CRAHN) for effective multimedia communications such as multicast communication which is very much intend to the group communication that save network resources and bandwidth. In this paper, we would like to present the various multicasting routing protocols of cognitive based radio wireless ad-hoc networks (CR-WAN).},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel method for improving the energy efficiency in Cognitive Radio based wireless networks through optimisation of sensing duration and transmission duration. We analyse three different cases of allocating sensing time and transmission duration with in a Cognitive frame. The first case corresponds to optimising with respect to sensing duration alone, while keeping the transmission duration as decided by the frame duration or as decided by the transmit power constraints. Second case deals with optimization with respect to the transmit duration while the sensing duration is constant and the third case corresponds to optimising jointly with respect to both. Here, we consider the ratio of the sensing duration to the transmission duration. The problems are formulated as quasi-concave fractional programming problem. Results indicate that the third method is better compared to existing methods. Further, the computational complexity of this method is less compared to many existing methods.},

year={2017},

pages={1-1},
abstract={A Bayesian data-mining approach is introduced for dynamic spectrum sensing in spectrum-heterogeneous cognitive radio networks (CRNs). The goal is to find the spectrum opportunities in temporal, spectral, and spatial domains in the presence of unreliable sensing data and unavailable location information. In spectrum-heterogeneous networks, the availability of spectrum varies over the space and different sensors experience different spectrum opportunities. Thus, the measurements from sensors cannot be simply aggregated to detect the spectrum opportunities. Moreover, unreliable data will negatively impact the decision-making process. The task of inferring the spectrum status becomes even more challenging when the sensors are not equipped with location-finding technologies. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model to cluster the sensors solely based on their observations, not requiring any prior knowledge of the network topology, location of the sensors, or the number of clusters. After receiving the sensing data, the base station updates the probability distributions of cluster membership, channel availability, and device reliability. All the update rules are derived mathematically by the variational inference. Then, the distributions are employed to find spectrum opportunities via multi-label graph cuts method. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with respect to existing algorithms.},

abstract={The use of geolocation databases (GDBs) for enabling spectrum sharing has been mandated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the U.S. TV band and the 3.5 GHz band, and it is very likely to be adopted for spectrum sharing in other bands as well. Although using GDBs is a practical approach for enabling spectrum sharing, it raises a potentially serious operational security (OPSEC) problem, especially when some of the primary users (PUs) are federal government entities, including military users. In this paper, we show that malicious queriers can readily infer the locations of PUs by making multiple queries to the database even if the database’s responses to queries do not directly reveal such information. To address this issue, we propose a perturbation-based optimal obfuscation strategy that can be implemented by the GDB to preserve the location privacy of PUs. The proposed obfuscation strategy is optimal in the sense that it maximizes PUs’ location privacy while ensuring that the expected degradation in the secondary users’ (SUs’) utility due to obfuscated responses does not exceed a threshold. Using results from extensive simulations, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme in countering location inference attacks, including the inference strategy described in the paper.},

abstract={In this paper, we model a Stackelberg game in a simple Gaussian test channel where a human transmitter (leader) communicates a source message to a human receiver (follower).

Assuming that the value function is the squared distortion at both the transmitter and the receiver, we analyze the effects of the weight functions at both the transmitter and the receiver on optimal communication strategies, namely encoding at the transmitter and decoding at the receiver, in the Stackelberg sense. We show that the optimal strategies for the behavioral agents in the Stackelberg sense are identical to those designed for unbiased agents. At the same time, we also show that the prospect-theoretic distortions at both the transmitter and the receiver are both larger than the expected distortion, thus making behavioral agents less contended than unbiased agents. Consequently, the presence of cognitive biases increases the need for transmission power in order to achieve a given distortion at both transmitter and receiver.},

abstract={In this paper, we address the use of multi-layered sliding windows to detect the presence of a wireless network for cognitive radio applications. Although synchronization signals of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) has been used as the reference system, the proposed scheme is generic in principle. Our proposed scheme doesn't require any a priori knowledge of the exact synchronization sequences, so it can be classified as a coarse spectrum sensing technique. Firstly, the proposed detection scheme employs a sliding window technique to collect energies from the received primary synchronization sequence (PSS). After that, it uses the maximum of the energies collected from all windows as the decision statistic to detect the network coverage. We compared the proposed technique against other existing schemes that are commonly used in spectrum sensing. Depending on the channel condition and data transmission rate, our numerical results demonstrate that performance of the proposed scheme is more robust against the frequency selectivity of the channels.},

abstract={In this paper we consider the broadband-narrowband coexistence scenario where the unused spectral gaps in the professional mobile radio (PMR) frequency band are used for broadband data communications. Spectrally confined filter bank based multicarrier (FBMC) waveform is applied for broadband transmission in order to minimize the interference leakage between the new broadband system and the legacy narrowband system. Fast convolution filter banks (FC-FBs) are used for flexible waveform processing both on the transmitter and the receiver sides. Furthermore, subband energy detection based methods utilizing FC-FBs are proposed for robust spectrum sensing of the legacy PMR signals of the terrestrial trunked radio (TETRA) family. The main idea in this study is to observe the spectral variability due to primary transmissions by dividing the sensing frequency band into relatively narrow subbands and then comparing the subband energies. The flexibility of FC-FB makes it possible to optimize the broadband waveform processing and spectrum sensing filter characteristics independently. Our proposed maximum and minimum subband energy based approach shows improved robustness to the uncertainty of noise, considering also the interference due to power leakage effects.},

abstract={Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) has seen a growing interest in recent years due to spectrum scarcity. Cognitive radio is a necessary component to enable DSA. One key requirement for cognitive radio is the ability to blindly detect the presence of signals in time and frequency. One popular method for blind detection is computing a power spectral density estimate using the Welch periodogram. The Welch periodogram is optimally efficient under the assumption that received signals are in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise. However, the Welch periodogram is not robust against non-Gaussian noise. Robustness against non-Gaussian noise is desirable because many man-made devices - such as microwave ovens, WiFi co-channel, gas emissions, etc. - contaminate the spectrum with non-Gaussian noise. In this work, robust estimation techniques are applied to the Welch method to increase its robustness against non-Gaussian noise at the cost of estimation efficiency and computational ease. The increase in robustness of the modified Welch method (compared to the traditional Welch method) is demonstrated for the Middleton Class A non-Gaussian noise model. These robust techniques are shown to enable more reliable detection of signals contaminated by non-Gaussian noise.},

pages={858-863},
abstract={This paper presents the joint design of network coding and backpressure algorithm for cognitive radio networks and its implementation with software-defined radios (SDRs) in a high fidelity network emulation testbed. The backpressure algorithm is known to provide throughput optimal solutions to joint routing and scheduling for dynamic packet traffic. This solution applies to cognitive radio networks with spectrum dynamics changing over time and space, and supports joint routing and spectrum access without any need for end-to-end path maintenance. The backpressure algorithm is extended to multicast traffic with network coding deployed over virtual queues that represent different flows per session and destination. This extension is supported with different methods to decode packets at destinations. In the absence of a common control channel, distributed coordination with local information exchange is used to support neighborhood discovery, spectrum sensing and channel estimation that are integrated with joint routing, channel access and network coding. Cognitive network functionalities are implemented with GNU Radio and Python modules for different network layers, and used with USRP N210 radios. Practical radio implementation issues are addressed in a distributed wireless network setting, where USRP N210 radios communicate with each other through RFnest, a high fidelity wireless network emulation tool. RFnest provides realistic physical channel environment by digitally controlling path loss, fading, delay, topology and mobility effects. Extensive emulation test results are provided to assess throughput, backlog and energy consumption and verify the SDR implementation of joint network coding and backpressure algorithm under realistic channel and radio hardware effects.},

abstract={This paper explores several algorithms that sequentially select input values to probe a discrete memoryless binary output channel (DMBOC) and establish a communication rate close to the capacity C. Adapting techniques from pure-exploration multi-arm bandit problems, each algorithm strives to sample an unknown channel as few times as possible to maximize a lower-bound rate RL that: (1) holds with at least a specified probability and (2) is within a specified fraction of C. To assess performance, we first determine the minimum number of input samples O(N) required to prove a known DMBOC supports rate RL with high probability and then show (through empirical evidence) that an algorithm can `learn' the channel and achieve the same lower-bound rate using O (N log (N)) sequential channel probes. However, by changing the selection strategy to reduce the number of input selection decisions, empirical results show that sample complexity is further reduced to only O (N log (log (N))) sequential channel probes.},

volume={},

pages={569-574},
abstract={In mobile Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs), the frequent link breakage and wireless interference urged the need for novel stable routing solutions. In this paper, we propose STAR, a stable routing protocol that aims at selecting interference-free and durable paths. We investigate the particular Hidden interfering Primary User (HIPU) problem caused by the un-detectable presence of the primary user in the transmission range of the secondary users resulting on severe packet loss. While existing CRNs routing solution, generally, overlook the interference caused by the Hidden Interfering Primary User (HIPU), STAR defines a HIPU-free transmission zone, that enables successful transmission and selects a stable route that is free from interference along the path to the destination. STAR uses prediction based model to estimate the link stability and the link propagation delay. To quantitatively select the best stable links along the route, STAR implements an objective function, cognitive stable link (CSL), that captures node mobility, interference by the HIPU, link propagation delay, and the distance towards the destination. We evaluate STAR, while comparing its throughput, latency, and packet loss ratio to three other protocols, namely PCTC, J-SRCA and AODV. Evaluation on MATLAB shows that STAR achieves higher throughput while reducing the end-to-end latency and the packet loss in the network.},

abstract={Increased demand for wireless services has spurred research into spectrum co-existence between radar and communication systems. The effect of an unaltered radar interference on an uncoded communication receiver has been investigated for constellations used in commercial systems. However, the constellation design - possible for a cognitive transmitter-receiver pair - that maximizes the transmission rate for communication systems affected by Gaussian noise and radar interference has not yet been addressed and is tackled here. Two regimes are investigated: when the Interference-to-Noise Ratio (INR) of the radar signal is very low and very high compared to the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the communication signal. It is found that: (a) When INR≪SNR, the channel behaves as a complex-valued AWGN channel; the designed constellations exhibit a concentric (almost equilateral) hexagonal structure as the number of signal points increases, (b) When INR≫SNR≫1, the channel behaves as a real-valued phase-fading AWGN channel; the designed constellations are shaped as an (almost equally-spaced) pulse-amplitude modulation as the number of signal points increases, and (c) The designed constellations outperform practically-used ones in terms of the transmission rate.},

title={Evaluating physical-layer security for secondary users in cognitive radio systems with attackers},
year={2017},
volume={},

pages={659-665},
abstract={Cognitive radio network (CRN) is regarded as an emerging technology for better spectrum efficiency where unlicensed secondary users (SUs) sense RF spectrum to find idle channels and access them opportunistically without causing any harmful interference to licensed primary users (PUs). However, RF spectrum sensing and sharing along with reconfigurable capabilities of SUs bring severe security vulnerabilities in the network. In this paper, we analyze physical-layer security (secrecy rates) of SUs in CRN in the presence of eavesdroppers, jammers and PU emulators (PUEs) where SUs compete not only with jammers and eavesdroppers who are trying to reduce SU's secrecy rates but also against PUEs who are trying to compel the SUs from their current channel by imitating the behavior of PUs. In addition, a legitimate SU competes with other SUs with a sharing attitude for dynamic spectrum access to gain a high secrecy rate, however, the malicious users (i.e., attackers) attempt to abuse the channels egotistically. The main contribution of this work is the design of a game theoretic approach to maximize utilities (that is proportional to secrecy rates) of SUs in the presence of eavesdroppers, jammers and PUEs. Furthermore, SUs use signal energy and cyclostationary feature detection along with location verification technique to detect PUEs. As the proposed approach is generic and considers different attackers, it can be particularized to a situation with eavesdroppers only, jammers only or PUEs only while evaluating physical-layer security of SUs in CRN. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using results obtained from simulations. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms other existing methods.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose using a wireless-powered friendly jammer to enable secure communication between a source node and destination node, in the presence of an eavesdropper. We consider a two-phase communication protocol with fixed-rate transmission. In the first phase, wireless power transfer is conducted from the source to the jammer. In the second phase, the source transmits the information-bearing signal under the protection of a jamming signal sent by the jammer using the harvested energy in the first phase. We analytically characterize the long-term behavior of the proposed protocol and derive a closed-form expression for the throughput. We further optimize the rate parameters for maximizing the throughput subject to a secrecy outage probability constraint. Our analytical results show that the throughput performance differs significantly between the single-antenna jammer case and the multiantenna jammer case. For instance, as the source transmit power increases, the throughput quickly reaches an upper bound with single-antenna jammer, while the throughput grows unbounded with multiantenna jammer. Our numerical results also validate the derived analytical results.},

abstract={IA is a promising solution for the interference management of future wireless networks. On the other hand, physical layer security is a critical issue of wireless communications in the presence of adversaries. Recently, these two important fields tend to be researched closely together. In this article, some of the key results are summarized, and two primary attacks at the physical layer of IA-based networks, adversarial jamming and eavesdropping, are further studied. We first propose an anti-jamming scheme by aligning the jamming signal together with interference among users cooperatively when an adversarial jammer exists. Then an AN scheme is proposed, in which the external eavesdropping is disrupted by AN without introducing any additional interference to the legitimate network. To further analyze the potential threat, a collusive eavesdropping scheme by some hostile IA users in the network is also proposed. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of these schemes. Finally, some future challenges are also summarized.},

abstract={Secret and reliable communication presents a challenge involving a double dilemma for a user and an adversary. One challenge for the adversary is to decide between jamming and eavesdropping. While jamming can be quite effective in preventing reliable communication of the user, it can also be quite harmful for the adversary since he/she can be detected. On the other hand, eavesdropping is quite safe for the adversary; however, it sometimes may not be so efficient compared to jamming, if the adversary cannot respond to the information gleaned from eavesdropping in a timely manner. The user can either transmit, thus becoming vulnerable to malicious activity, or be in a silent mode in turn delaying his/her transmission. However, by combining these modes properly the user can assist an intruder detection system in detecting the adversary, since transmission can provoke the adversary into a jamming attack, and a strategically allocated silent mode while the jammer continues jamming can increase the probability of detecting the adversary. In this paper, to get insight into this problem, two simple stochastic games are proposed. Explicit solutions are found that lead to the characterization of some interesting properties. In particular, it is shown that under certain conditions, incorporating in the transmission protocol a time slot dealing just with the detection of malicious threats can improve the secrecy and reliability of the communication without extra transmission delay.},

abstract={This paper investigates the ergodic achievable secrecy rate (EASR) of multiple-antenna amplify-and-forward relay systems, where one eavesdropper can wiretap the relay. To reveal the capability of the multiple-antenna relay in improving the secrecy performance, we derive new tight closed-form expressions of the EASR for three secure transmission schemes: artificial noise aided precoding (ANP), destination based jamming (DBJ) and eigen-beamforming (EB). We also derive the lower bounds of the EASR for ANP and DBJ with a large antenna array at the relay, and investigate their corresponding asymptotic performance in the high SNR and low SNR regimes to show valuable intrinsic insights as well. Based on the asymptotic analysis, we optimally allocate the power to the information signal and the artificial noise. Both the analysis and simulation results indicate that, in the moderate-to-high SNR regime, ANP achieves considerable performance gain over DBJ and EB, while in the low SNR regime, EB outperforms the other two schemes with equal power allocation. As SNR grows large, the EASR of EB approaches a constant independent of the first hop channel. Moreover, in the high SNR regime, it is optimal to allocate around half of total power to artificial noise for ANP and most of the power to artificial noise for DBJ.},

year={2016}, 
volume={15},

pages={8009-8024}, 
abstract={In this paper, we investigate the secrecy performance of multiuser dual-hop relay networks where a base station (BS) communicates with multiple legitimate users through the assistance of a trustful regenerative relay in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. In particular, the maximal ratio transmission scheme is exploited at the BS and a threshold-based multiuser scheduling scheme is employed over the legitimate users, while concerning the imperfect decoding at the regenerative relay. To evaluate the secrecy performance of the considered system, two practical situations are addressed based on the availability of eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI), i.e., Scenario I, where the eavesdropper's CSI is not available at the relay, and Scenario II, where the eavesdropper's CSI is available at the relay. For both the scenarios, we further consider two eavesdropping modes, i.e., colluding eavesdropping and non-colluding eavesdropping. For Scenario I, new exact and asymptotic closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) are derived. For Scenario II, we derive new exact and asymptotic closed-form expressions for the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR). The asymptotic SOPs demonstrate that the secrecy diversity order is independent of the number of legitimate users NB and eavesdroppers NE, the number of antennas equipped at eavesdroppers AE, as well as the fading factor of the wiretap channel mE. Furthermore, we also determine the secrecy multiplexing gain and the power cost to explicitly quantify the impact of the legitimate channel and wiretap channel on the ESR. Our findings demonstrate that increasing the switching threshold, the number of antennas at the BS, and the number of legitimate users has a positive impact on secrecy performance.},

abstract={Anti-jamming interference alignment (IA) is an effective method for battling adversarial jammers for IA networks. Nevertheless, the number of antennas may not be enough to make it feasible in anti-jamming IA. Besides, the abundant power from the jammers and interferences, which used to be deemed as a harmful factor, can be exploited for energy harvesting (EH) by the legitimate users as a power supply. Thus, in this paper, we propose an anti-jamming opportunistic IA (OIA) scheme with wireless EH, which optimizes the transmission rate and EH together. In the proposed scheme, to make the anti-jamming IA network feasible, we select some of the users to transmit information at each time slot, and EH is performed by the other unselected users. Furthermore, to improve the performance of the proposed scheme, EH is also performed by the selected users, and the transmit power and power partition coefficient are jointly optimized to minimize the total transmit power of the OIA network. To reduce the computational complexity of the joint optimization, a suboptimal algorithm is also developed with much lower complexity. Extensive simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed anti-jamming OIA scheme with wireless EH.},

abstract={We investigate the secrecy performance of dual-hop amplify-and-forward multi-antenna relaying systems over Rayleigh fading channels, considering the direct link between the source and the destination. In order to exploit the available direct link and the multiple antennas for secrecy improvement, different linear processing schemes at the relay and different diversity combining techniques at the destination are proposed, namely: 1) zero-forcing/maximal ratio combining (ZF/MRC); 2) ZF/selection combining (ZF/SC); 3) maximal ratio transmission/MRC (MRT/MRC); and 4) MRT/SC. For all these schemes, we present new closed-form approximations for the secrecy outage probability. Moreover, we investigate a benchmark scheme, i.e., cooperative jamming/ZF (CJ/ZF), where the secrecy outage probability is obtained in exact closed-form. In addition, we present asymptotic secrecy outage expressions for all the proposed schemes in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, in order to characterize key design parameters, such as secrecy diversity order and secrecy array gain. The outcomes of this paper can be summarized as follows: 1) MRT/MRC and MRT/SC achieve a full diversity order of M + 1, ZF/MRC and ZF/SC achieve a diversity order of M, while CJ/ZF only achieves unit diversity order, where M is the number of antennas at the relay; 2) ZF/MRC (ZF/SC) outperforms the corresponding MRT/MRC(MRT/SC) in the low SNR regime, while becomes inferior to the corresponding MRT/MRC (MRT/SC) in the high SNR; and 3) all the proposed schemes tend to outperform the CJ/ZF with moderate number of antennas, and linear processing schemes with MRC attain better performance than those with SC.},

abstract={There is a growing need for government agencies to monitor suspicious communication links to prevent crimes and terror attacks. In this paper, we study a legitimate surveillance scenario where a legitimate monitor aims to intercept the suspicious communication between a transmitter and a receiver over fading channels. The legitimate monitor can eavesdrop (decode) the information of the suspicious link only when its achievable data rate is no smaller than that at the suspicious receiver. In practice, the legitimate eavesdropping is challenging, especially when the legitimate monitor is far from the suspicious transmitter. To overcome this issue, we propose a new approach, namely proactive eavesdropping via cognitive jamming, in which the legitimate monitor purposely jams the receiver and changes the suspicious communication (e.g., to a smaller data rate) in order to overhear easily. In particular, we consider delay-sensitive and delay-insensitive applications for the suspicious transmission, under which the legitimate monitor maximizes the eavesdropping non-outage probability and the relative eavesdropping rate, respectively, by optimizing its jamming power allocation over different fading states subject to an average power constraint. We present efficient algorithms for optimally solving the formulated problems. Numerical results show that thanks to the cognitive jamming, the proposed proactive eavesdropping scheme greatly outperforms the conventional passive eavesdropping without jamming.},

We first present online learning algorithms to maximize the jamming efficacy against static transmitter-receiver pairs and prove that these algorithms converge to the optimal (in terms of the error rate inflicted at the victim and the energy used) jamming strategy. Even more importantly, we prove that the rate of convergence to the optimal jamming strategy is sublinear, i.e., the learning is fast in comparison to existing reinforcement learning algorithms, which is particularly important in dynamically changing wireless environments. Also, we characterize the performance of the proposed bandit-based learning algorithm against multiple static and adaptive transmitter-receiver pairs.},

abstract={In this paper, we study the performance of multiuser single-input multiple-output mixed radio frequency (RF)/free space optical (FSO) relay network with opportunistic user scheduling. The considered system includes multiple users, one amplify-and-forward relay, one destination, and a multipleantenna eavesdropper. The users are connected with the relay node through RF links and the relay is connected with the destination through an FSO link. Both maximum ratio combining and selection combining schemes are used at the multipleantenna relay to combine the signal received from the best user on different antennas. The RF/FSO channels models are assumed to follow Nakagami-m/gamma-gamma fading models with pointing errors. Closed-form expressions are derived for the outage probability, average symbol error probability, and ergodic channel capacity. Then, the power of the selected best user is determined to minimize the system asymptotic outage probability under the dominant RF or FSO link. Then, the considered system secrecy performance is investigated, where the closedform expressions for the intercept probability are derived. Finally, we propose a new cooperative jamming model in which the worst user is selected by the authorized system to jam the existing eavesdropper. Monte-Carlo simulations are provided to validate the achieved exact and asymptotic results.},

The cooperative jammer is assumed to be an FD node that is solely charged by the ambient radio-frequency transmissions. We investigate the self-energy recycling at the cooperative jammer and derive a sufficient condition for the cooperative jammer to operate as a node with reliable energy supply.

In the underlying tier, the transmitter sends unclassified information and the receiver works in the half-duplex (HD) mode receiving the desired signal. In the overlaid tier, the transmitter delivers confidential information in the presence of randomly located eavesdroppers, and the receiver works in the FD mode radiating jamming signals to confuse eavesdroppers and receiving the desired signal simultaneously. We provide a comprehensive performance analysis and network design under a stochastic geometry framework. Specifically, we consider the scenarios where each FD receiver uses single- and multi-antenna jamming, and analyze the connection probability and the secrecy outage probability of a typical FD receiver by deriving accurate expressions and more tractable approximations for the two probabilities. We also determine the optimal deployment density of the FD-mode tier to maximize the network-wide secrecy throughput subject to constraints including the given dual probabilities and the network-wide throughput of the HD-mode tier. Numerical results are demonstrated to verify our theoretical findings, and show that the network-wide secrecy throughput is significantly improved by properly deploying the FD-mode tier.},

abstract={Security is an issue of paramount importance, yet is it a significant challenge for wireless communications, which becomes more intricate when facing a full duplex (FD) active eavesdropper capable of performing eavesdropping and jamming simultaneously. In this paper, we investigate the physical layer security issue in the presence of an FD active eavesdropper, who launches jamming attacks to further improve the eavesdropping. The jamming, however, also results in self-interference at the eavesdropper itself. This security problem is formulated within a hierarchical game framework where the eavesdropper acts as the leader and the legitimate user is the follower. In particular, we first investigate the follower's secrecy rate maximization problem and derive the optimal legitimate transmission strategy. Then, the leader's wiretap rate maximization is expressed as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC). Leveraging the concavity of the follower's problem, we transform the MPEC problem into a single-level optimization and obtain the jamming power allocation strategy by applying the primal-dual interior-point method. Moreover, we analyze the situations where only partial channel state information is available at the legitimate user and the corresponding impacts on the game. Finally, we present extensive simulation results to validate our theoretical analysis.},

abstract={In this paper, distributed competitive interactions between a secondary user (SU) transmitter-receiver pair and a jammer are investigated using a game-theoretic framework under physical interference restrictions, power budget constraints, and incomplete knowledge of channel gains. In this game, the SU transmitter is expected to choose its power strategy with the objective of satisfying a minimum signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) at the corresponding receiver. Similarly, the jammer's objective is to strategically allocate its power so that the SINR constraint of the SU is not satisfied. Due to a lack of complete information, this strategic power allocation problem between the two players is modeled as a Bayesian game for which the self-enforcing strategies of the SU transmitter-receiver pair and the jammer are analyzed. Furthermore, probability distributions are employed by the corresponding players to model the incomplete nature of the game. The solution of the game corresponds to Nash equilibria points. Equilibrium analysis is carried out by considering the mixed strategy solution space and numerical examples are presented for illustration.},

volume={16},

pages={2790-2806}, 
abstract={To enhance the national security, there is a growing need for authorized parties to legitimately monitor suspicious communication links for preventing intended crimes and terror attacks. In this paper, we propose a new wireless information surveillance paradigm by investigating a scenario, where a legitimate monitor aims to intercept a suspicious wireless link over fading channels. The legitimate monitor can successfully eavesdrop (decode) the information of the suspicious link at each fading state only when its achievable data rate is no smaller than that at the suspicious receiver. We propose a new approach, namely, proactive eavesdropping via cognitive jamming, in which the legitimate monitor purposely jams the receiver in a full-duplex mode so as to change the suspicious communication (e.g., to a smaller data rate) for overhearing more efficiently. By assuming perfect self-interference cancelation (SIC) and global channel state information (CSI) at the legitimate monitor, we characterize the fundamental information-theoretic limits of proactive eavesdropping. We consider both delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant applications for the suspicious communication, under which the legitimate monitor maximizes the eavesdropping non-outage probability (for event-based monitoring) and the relative eavesdropping rate (for content analysis), respectively, by optimizing the jamming power allocation over different fading states subject to an average power constraint. Numerical results show that the proposed proactive eavesdropping via cognitive jamming approach greatly outperforms other benchmark schemes. Furthermore, by extending to a more practical scenario with residual SI and local CSI, we design an efficient online cognitive jamming scheme inspired by the optimal cognitive jamming with perfect SIC and global CSI.},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel power beacon-assisted wiretap channel, where an energy constrained source, powered by a dedicated power beacon, aims to establish secure communications with a legitimate user in the presence of an eavesdropper. The power beacon and the source are assumed to have multiple antennas, while the legitimate user and the eavesdropper are equipped with a single antenna each. Considering a time-switching protocol, the power beacon first charges the source through wireless power transfer, and then acts as a friendly jammer to assist the source for secure communication. Depending on the available channel state information (CSI) at the power beacon, we propose several different jamming schemes for secrecy performance enhancement. Closed-form expressions are derived for the achievable secrecy outage probability of the proposed schemes. In addition, simple and accurate approximations are obtained at the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. The outcomes suggest that jamming is an effective approach to improve the secrecy performance: with full CSI available at the power beacon, employing simple zero-forcing scheme attains significant secrecy diversity gain and without the CSI of the eavesdropper link, jamming provides only some array gain. Moreover, we show that the proposed limited feedback-based random beamforming is an effective approach, which may outperform the antenna selection scheme. Furthermore, numerical results reveal that there exists a unique time switching ratio that maximizes the effective secrecy throughput.},

pages={973-986}, 
abstract={In cognitive radio networks, the cross-channel gain from a cognitive transmitter (CT) to a primary receiver (PR) is critical for spectrum sharing and obtaining the cross-channel gain is very difficult. Even though proactive estimation allows the CT to autonomously estimate the cross-channel gain, it may cause severe interference to the PR. This raises a new issue for spectrum sensing, called spectrum sensing interference. In this paper, we deal with the sensing interference and propose a relay-assisted method to conduct the proactive estimation, which obtains the cross-channel gain with much less interference to the PR. In our method, we let the CT act as a full-duplex amplify-and-forward relay to probe the close-loop power control between primary transceivers. By measuring the power adjustment of the primary signal, the CT estimates the cross-channel gain. Simulation results indicate that our method can reduce the sensing interference to an extremely low level.},

abstract={The smart jammers pose a severe threat to wireless communications due to their abilities of learning the users' transmission strategies. A Stackelberg game can be formulated to model and analyze the hierarchical interactions between the user and the smart jammer. In this letter, an antijamming Bayesian Stackelberg game with incomplete information is proposed. In the proposed game, the user who acts as the leader has the privilege over the smart jammer and takes actions first, whereas the smart jammer acting as the follower moves subsequently. Moreover, the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) is derived, and the existence and the uniqueness of SE are demonstrated. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed antijamming Bayesian Stackelberg game.},

abstract={We consider the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap channel under a minimum receiver-side power constraint in addition to the usual maximum transmitter-side power constraint. This problem is motivated by energy harvesting communications with wireless energy transfer, where an added goal is to deliver a minimum amount of energy to a receiver in addition to delivering secure data to another receiver. In this paper, we characterize the exact secrecy capacity of the MIMO wiretap channel under transmitter and receiver-side power constraints. We first show that solving this problem is equivalent to solving the secrecy capacity of the wiretap channel under a double-sided correlation matrix constraint on the channel input. We show the converse by extending the channel enhancement technique to our case. We present two achievable schemes that achieve the secrecy capacity: the first achievable scheme uses a Gaussian codebook with a fixed mean, and the second achievable scheme uses artificial noise (or cooperative jamming) together with a Gaussian codebook. The role of the mean or the artificial noise is to enable energy transfer without sacrificing from the secure rate. This is the first instance of a channel model where either the use of a mean signal or the use of channel prefixing via artificial noise is strictly necessary for the MIMO wiretap channel. We then extend our work to consider a maximum receiver-side power constraint instead of a minimum receiver-side power constraint. This problem is motivated by cognitive radio applications, where an added goal is to decrease the received signal energy (interference temperature) at a receiver. We further extend our results to: requiring receiver-side power constraints at both receivers; considering secrecy constraints at both receivers to study broadcast channels with confidential messages; and removing the secrecy constraints to study the classical broadcast channel.},

abstract={In this paper, we examine the physical layer security for cooperative wireless networks with multiple intermediate nodes, where the decode-and-forward protocol is considered. We propose a new joint relay and jammer selection (JRJS) scheme for protecting wireless communications against eavesdropping, where an intermediate node is selected as the relay for the sake of forwarding the source signal to the destination and meanwhile, the remaining intermediate nodes are employed to act as friendly jammers, which broadcast the artificial noise for disturbing the eavesdropper. We further investigate the power allocation among the source, relay and friendly jammers for maximizing the secrecy rate of proposed JRJS scheme, and derive a closed-form sub-optimal solution. Specifically, all the intermediate nodes, which successfully decode the source signal, are considered as relay candidates. For each candidate, we derive the sub-optimal closed-form power allocation solution and obtain the secrecy rate result of the corresponding JRJS scheme. Then, the candidate, which is capable of achieving the highest secrecy rate, is selected as the relay. Two assumptions about the channel state information (CSI), namely the full CSI (FCSI) and partial CSI (PCSI), are considered. Simulation results show that the proposed JRJS scheme outperforms the conventional pure relay selection, pure jamming, and generalized singular-value-decomposition-based beamforming schemes in terms of secrecy rate. Additionally, the proposed FCSI-based power allocation and PCSI-based power allocation schemes both achieve higher secrecy rates than the equal power allocation scheme.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the problem of jammer selection for securing Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks (CCRNs) with the Multiple-Input Multiple- Output (MIMO) capability. In the CCRN under our consideration, there exist a pair of Primary Users (PUs), a relay node, a number of Secondary User (SU) pairs, and an eavesdropper. The PUs need to select a pair of SUs as jammers to interfere with the eavesdropper so as to preserve the secrecy of their wireless communications. To address this problem, we propose an Optimal Stopping based Jammer Selection (OSJS) scheme. Specifically, OSJS examines the primary secrecy capacity for each candidate SU pair in a sequential order. The first SU pair that makes the primary secrecy capacity higher than an optimal threshold is selected as the jammers. The optimal threshold is calculated based on the distribution function of the primary secrecy capacity. We derive the distribution function from the chi-square distribution function of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) under the MIMO channel conditions. Since our OSJS scheme does not have to check all the candidate SU pairs, much time can be saved for data transmissions. Our rigorous analysis and simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can achieve secure communications with improved network throughput.},

abstract={Air pollution has become a major issue in the modern megalopolis because of industrial emissions and increasing urbanization along with traffic jams and the heating/cooling of buildings. Monitoring urban air quality is therefore required by municipalities and the civil society. Current monitoring systems rely on reference sensing stations that are precise but massive, costly, and, therefore, seldom. In this paper, we focus on an alternative or complementary approach, with a network of low cost and autonomic wireless sensors, aiming at a finer spatiotemporal granularity of sensing. Generic deployment models in the literature are not adapted to the stochastic nature of pollution sensing. Our main contribution is to design integer linear programming models that compute sensor deployments capturing both the coverage of pollution under time-varying weather conditions and the connectivity of the infrastructure. We evaluate our deployment models on a real data set of Greater London. We analyze the performance of the proposed models and show that our joint coverage and connectivity formulation is tight and compact, with a reasonable enough execution time. We also conduct extensive simulations to derive engineering insights for effective deployments of air pollution sensors in an urban environment.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the secrecy performance of full-duplex multi-antenna spectrum-sharing wiretap networks in which a jamming signal is simultaneously transmitted by the full-duplex secondary receiver (Bob) based on the zero forcing beamforming (ZFB) algorithm. For the security enhancement, we propose the two antenna reception schemes: 1) random selection combining (RSC) where Bob selects LB antennas at random to combine the received signals and 2) generalized selection combining (GSC) where Bob selects LB strongest antennas to combine the received signals. We derive the exact closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability of full-duplex multi-antenna spectrum-sharing wiretap networks with ZFB algorithm. In order to explore a new design of the proposed schemes, we provide tractable asymptotic approximations for the secrecy outage probability in high signal-to-noise ratio regime under two distinct scenarios. From the analysis, we demonstrate that: 1) when the main channel is much better than the eavesdropper's channel, GSC/ZFB scheme achieves full diversity NB, while RSC/ZFB scheme only achieves partial diversity LB and 2) GSC/ZFB scheme achieves better secrecy performance than RSC/ZFB with different antenna numbers at Bob.},

abstract={In this paper, a game theory-based cooperation scheme is investigated to enhance the physical layer security in both primary and secondary transmissions of a cognitive radio network (CRN). In CRNs, the primary network may decide to lease its own spectrum for a fraction of time to the secondary nodes in exchange of appropriate remuneration. We consider the secondary transmitter node as a trusted relay for primary transmission to forward primary messages in a decode-and-forward fashion and, at the same time, allows part of its available power to be used to transmit artificial noise (i.e., jamming signal) to enhance primary and secondary secrecy rates. In order to allocate power between message and jamming signals, we formulate and solve the optimization problem for maximizing the secrecy rates under malicious attempts from eavesdroppers. We then analyze the cooperation between the primary and secondary nodes from a game-theoretic perspective where we model their interaction as a Stackelberg game with a theoretically proved and computed Stackelberg equilibrium. We show that the spectrum leasing based on trading secondary access for cooperation by means of relay and jammer is a promising framework for enhancing security in CRNs.},

year={2016},

pages={100-108}, 
abstract={In a cognitive radio (CR) network, a secondary user learns the spectrum environment and dynamically accesses the channel where the primary user is inactive. At the same time, a primary user emulation (PUE) attacker can send falsified primary user signals and prevent the secondary user from utilizing the available channel. Although there is a large body of work on PUE attack detection and defending strategies, the best attacking strategies that an attacker can apply have not been well studied. In this paper, for the first time, we study the optimal PUE attack strategies without any prior knowledge on the primary user activity characteristics and the secondary user access strategies. We formulate the problem as a non-stochastic online learning problem where the attacker needs to dynamically decide the attacking channel in each time slot based on its attacking experience in previous slots. The challenge in our problem is that the PUE attacker cannot observe the reward on the attacked channel because it never knows if a secondary user ever tries to access it. To solve this challenge, we propose an attack-but-observe-another (ABOA) scheme, in which the attacker attacks one channel in the spectrum sensing phase, but observes at least one other channel in the data transmission phase. We propose two non-stochastic online learning-based attacking algorithms, EXP3-DO and OPT-RO, which select the observing channel deterministically based on the attacking channel and uniform randomly, respectively. EXP3-DO employs an existing theoretical framework and is suboptimal. OPT-RO is based on the new proposed theoretical framework and is optimal. They achieve regret in the order of O(T2/3) and O(√T), respectively. T is the number of slots the CR network operates. We also generalize OPT-RO to multichannel observation cases. We show consistency between simulation and analytical results under various system parameters.},

Our theoretical model takes into account various channel conditions such as the path loss and Rayleigh fading as well as the placement schemes of jammers. Our extensive numerical results show that using jammers in WNoT can effectively reduce the eavesdropping risk. Besides, our results also show that the eavesdropping risk heavily depends on both the channel conditions and the placements of jammers.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider beamforming design for an underlay cognitive radio multiple-input single-output broadcast channel, where a pair of secondary users coexists with multiple primary receivers. There exist multiple malicious eavesdroppers who attempt to overhear the confidential messages from the secondary system. When the channel state information of the eavesdroppers can only be obtained in the statistical sense, we transform the constraint which results from the statistical information of the passive eavesdroppers into a linear matrix inequality and convex constraint. To improve the secrecy rate of the secondary system, we aim to design a jamming noise to degrade the eavesdroppers. The main objective of the design is to maximize the secrecy rate of the secondary system while satisfying all the interference power constraints at the primary users and per-antenna power constraint at the secondary transmitter. The original problem is a nonconvex program, which can be reformulated to a convex program by applying the rank relaxation method. To this end, we prove that the rank relaxation is tight and it can be efficiently solved. Moreover, to develop an efficient resource allocation scheme we transform the relaxed problem into an equivalent problem based on a duality result.},

abstract={We propose a robust resource allocation framework to improve the physical layer security in the presence of an active eavesdropper. In the considered system, we assume that both legitimate receiver and eavesdropper are full-duplex (FD) while most works in the literature concentrate on passive eavesdroppers and half-duplex (HD) legitimate receivers. In this paper, the adversary intends to optimize its transmit and jamming signal parameters so as to minimize the secrecy data rate of the legitimate transmission. In the literature, assuming that the receiver operates in HD mode, secrecy data rate maximization problems subject to the power transmission constraint have been considered in which cooperating nodes act as jammers to confound the eavesdropper. This paper investigates an alternative solution in which we take advantage of FD capability of the receiver to send jamming signals against the eavesdroppers. The proposed self-protection scheme eliminates the need for external helpers. Moreover, we consider the channel state information uncertainty on the links between the active eavesdropper and other legitimate nodes of the network. Optimal power allocation is then obtained based on the worst-case secrecy data rate maximization, under a legitimate transmitter power constraint in the presence of the active eavesdropper. Numerical results confirm the advantage of the proposed secrecy design and in certain conditions, demonstrate substantial performance gain over the conventional approaches.},

It has been an effective method for improving physical-layer security in wireless communication. In this paper, cautious jamming strategy based on optimal jammer selection method is proposed. More specifically, by using perfect channel state information, cautious jamming strategy selects an optimal jammer to improve the secrecy performance. For the purpose of comparison, we consider the direct jamming strategy and the adaptive jamming strategy as benchmark schemes. Closed-form expressions of the exact intercept probability for three jamming strategies are derived over Rayleigh fading channels and the theoretical analysis is validated by Monte-Carlo simulation. Both the analytical and the simulation results show that: 1) increasing the power of jammer is an effective approach to mitigate the intercept probability; 2) the intercept probability can be decreased and the wiretapped range of eavesdropper can be reduced by increasing the number of jammer; 3) by using perfect CSI and selecting optimal jammer, cautious jamming strategy outperforms direct jamming strategy and adaptive jamming strategy.},

abstract={The effectiveness and the simple implementation of physical layer jammers make them an essential threat for wireless networks. In a multihop wireless network, where jammers can interfere with the transmission of user messages at intermediate nodes along the path, one can employ jamming oblivious routing and then employ physical-layer techniques (e.g., spread spectrum) to suppress jamming. However, whereas these approaches can provide significant gains, the residual jamming can still severely limit system performance. This motivates the consideration of routing approaches that account for the differences in the jamming environment between different paths. First, we take a straightforward approach where an equal outage probability is allocated to each link along a path and develop a minimum energy routing solution. Next, we demonstrate the shortcomings of this approach and then consider the joint problem of outage allocation and routing by employing an approximation to the link outage probability. This yields an efficient and effective routing algorithm that only requires knowledge of the measured jamming at each node. Numerical results demonstrate that the amount of energy saved by the proposed methods with respect to a standard minimum energy routing algorithm, especially for parameters appropriate for terrestrial wireless networks, is substantial.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate cooperative secure communications in a four-node cognitive radio network where the secondary receiver is treated as a potential eavesdropper with respect to the primary transmission. The secondary user is allowed to transmit his own signals under the condition that the primary user's secrecy rate and transmission scheme are intact. Under this setting, we derive the secondary user's achievable rates and the related constraints to guarantee the primary user's weak secrecy rate, when Gelfand-Pinsker coding is used at the secondary transmitter. In addition, we propose a multiphase transmission scheme to include: 1) the phases of the clean relaying with cooperative jamming and 2) the latency to successfully decode the primary message at the secondary transmitter. A capacity upper bound for the secondary user is also derived. Numerical results show that: 1) the proposed scheme can outperform the traditional ones by properly selecting the secondary user's parameters of different transmission schemes according to the relative positions of the nodes and 2) the derived capacity upper bound is close to the secondary user's achievable rate within 0.3 bits/channel use, especially when the secondary transmitter/receiver is far/close enough to the primary receiver/transmitter, respectively. Thereby, a smart secondary transmitter is able to adapt the relaying and cooperative jamming to guarantee primary secrecy rates and to transmit its own data at the same time from relevant geometric positions.},

abstract={This paper studies the secrecy performance of an untrusted amplify-and-forward relaying network where both the relaying and the direct links are used to convey the source's information. Since relays act as eavesdroppers, a source-based jamming technique is proposed to keep the source's message secret from these helper nodes. We analyze the secrecy capacity of partial relay selection based on outdated channel state information. The study is conducted analytically by deriving the lower-bound expression for the ergodic secrecy capacity (ESC). We demonstrate through the simulation results the tightness of the derived bound. The use of the direct link is shown to improve the secrecy performance of the proposed scheme. In this case, we found that ESC performance with maximum ratio combining at the destination is better than that with selection combining. The system performance worsens as the correlation coefficient decreases. Furthermore, the maximum of ESC is achieved when relays are in the middle between the source and the destination with equal power allocation between the information and the jamming signals at the source.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider the multi-channel power optimization to enhance security for a full-duplex (FD) transmission pair. The FD-enabled concurrent transmissions between the users, on one hand, induce self-interference at their own receivers, and on the other hand, act as friendly jamming to degrade the eavesdropping for the other. To elaborate on such a tradeoff for secrecy maximization, we investigate the power allocation problem from both centralized and distributed perspectives. For the centralized approach, we intend to maximize users' sum secrecy rate. The non-concave problem is tackled by the difference-of-two-concave-functions programming, where the local optimal is obtained by iteratively solving a series of concave problems. For the distributed approach, we formulate the secrecy rate competition between the users as a game. The Nash equilibrium of the game is then achieved by the users' best-response iterations. In particular, by leveraging the theory of variational inequality, we derive the conditions for the equilibrium to be unique. Finally, we present simulation results that verify our theoretical analysis. Also, it is demonstrated that, for the security performance of FD and half- duplex transmissions, one may outperform the other depending on the self-interference cancellation.},

abstract={In this paper, we examine the physical-layer security for a spectrum sharing system consisting of multiple source-destination pairs, which dynamically access their shared spectrum for data transmissions in the presence of an eavesdropper. We propose a source cooperation (SC) aided opportunistic jamming framework for protecting the transmission confidentiality of the spectrum sharing system against eavesdropping. Specifically, when a source node is allowed to access the shared spectrum for data transmissions, another source is opportunistically selected in the spectrum sharing system to transmit an artificial noise for disrupting the eavesdropper without affecting the legitimate transmissions. We present two specific SC aided opportunistic jamming schemes, namely the SC aided random jammer selection (RJS) and optimal jammer selection (OJS), which are referred to as the SC-RJS and SC-OJS, respectively. We also consider the conventional non-cooperation as a baseline. We derive closed-form intercept probability expressions for the non-cooperation, SC-RJS and SC-OJS schemes, based on which their secrecy diversity gains are determined through an asymptotic intercept probability analysis in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. It is proved that the conventional non-cooperation exhibits a secrecy diversity of zero, whereas the proposed SC-RJS and SC-OJS achieve a higher secrecy diversity of one. This also surprisingly means that no additional secrecy diversity gain is achieved by the optimal jammer selection compared to the random selection strategy. In addition, numerical results show that the intercept probability performance of the SC-OJS is always better than that of the SC-RJS and non-cooperation, even when the legitimate channel is worse than the eavesdropping channel.},

abstract={For a confidential communication, we develop the transmission strategies by taking into account trust degree among users, which shows how much a user can be trusted in terms of an eavesdropping attack. For a single potential eavesdropper (PE) case, we derive an optimal power allocation for confidential message and jamming signal to maximize an expected secrecy rate with respect to the trust degree. In order to further increase the expected secrecy rate, by exploiting relaying transmission via PE, we derive the optimal transmission strategy and corresponding power allocation based on the threshold of trust degree. Furthermore, to investigate the effect of the accuracy of trust degree, we analyze the expected secrecy rate loss caused by an estimation error of the trust degree and provide the robust power allocation based on imperfect trust degree. Finally, we extend the results to the case of confidential communication in the presence of multiple PEs. Our analytical and numerical results show that the proposed strategies achieve substantially higher secrecy rates than that without exploiting the trust degree of users.},

abstract={This paper considers optimal multiband transmission under hostile jamming, where both the authorized user and the jammer are power-limited and operate against each other. The strategic decision making of the authorized user and the jammer is modeled as a two-party zero-sum game, where the payoff function is the capacity that can be achieved by the authorized user in the presence of the jammer. First, we investigate the game under AWGN channels. It is found that: either for the authorized user to maximize its capacity, or for the jammer to minimize the capacity of the authorized user, the best strategy for both of them is to distribute the transmission power or jamming power uniformly over all the available spectrum. The minimax capacity can be calculated based on the channel bandwidth and the signal-to-jamming and noise ratio, and it matches with the Shannon channel capacity formula. Second, we consider frequency selective fading channels. We characterize the dynamic relationship between the optimal signal power allocation and the optimal jamming power allocation in the minimax game, and then propose an iterative water pouring algorithm to find the optimal power allocation schemes for both the authorized user and the jammer.},

pages={208-215}, 
abstract={The commercial success of LTE makes it the primary standard for 4G cellular technology, and its evolution paves the path for 5G technology. Furthermore, LTE Unlicensed has been proposed recently to allow cellular network operators to offload some of their data traffic to LTE component carriers operating in the unlicensed band. Hence, it is critical to ensure that the LTE system performs effectively even in harsh signaling environments in both licensed and unlicensed spectrum. This article analyzes the effect of different levels of RF spoofing applied to LTE. RF spoofing affects LTE devices during the initial cell selection process, where a strong nearby cell can impede access to a serving LTE network. This is a serious threat and can be caused unintentionally, in the case of dense and uncoordinated LTE deployment in unlicensed spectrum, or intentionally, where an adversary sets up a fake LTE cell in either licensed or unlicensed LTE spectrum. This article analyzes and experimentally demonstrates the severity of these threats for the evolution of LTE and proposes effective mitigation techniques to prevent denial of service. These mitigation techniques improve the cell selection process at the LTE user equipment, and are backward-compatible with existing LTE networks. We recommend that these modifications be enforced in future releases for increasing the availability and scalability of LTE.},

abstract={We consider a well-known beamforming approach that induces jamming signals to avoid eavesdropping from a transmitter equipped with an antenna array in this paper. With this beamforming, which is called masked beamforming, in order to guarantee a certain instantaneous secrecy rate, we formulate robust beamforming problems with a constraint that deals with the eavesdropper channel's uncertainty and find the solutions. Unlike a guaranteed ergodic secrecy rate, this guaranteed instantaneous secrecy rate allows us to use codes of short codewords for secure communications with masked beamforming over slow-fading channels. In addition, since the optimal solutions are found in closed form, we do not need to resort to any convex optimization solvers.},

abstract={In this paper, the optimal jamming of wireless localization systems is investigated. Two optimal power allocation schemes are proposed for jammer nodes in the presence of total and peak power constraints. In the first scheme, power is allocated to jammer nodes in order to maximize the average Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of target nodes, whereas in the second scheme, the power allocation is performed for the aim of maximizing the minimum CRLB of target nodes. Both the schemes are formulated as linear programs, and a closed-form solution is obtained for the first scheme. For the second scheme, under certain conditions, the property of full total power utilization is specified, and a closed-form solution is obtained when the total power is lower than a specific threshold. In addition, it is shown that non-zero power is allocated to at most NT jammer nodes according to the second scheme in the absence of peak power constraints, where NT is the number of target nodes. In the presence of parameter uncertainty, robust versions of the power allocation schemes are proposed. Simulation results are presented to investigate the performance of the proposed schemes and to illustrate the theoretical results.},

We study a typical VLC scenario with one transmitter, one legitimate receiver, and one eavesdropper. Specifically, we compute the achievable secrecy rate for various input signaling distributions, including the truncated generalized normal (TGN) and uniform distributions. The transmitter is equipped with multiple light sources, while the legitimate and unauthorized receivers are each equipped with a single photodetector. We analyze the achievable secrecy rates via transmit beamforming and artificial noise. In addition, both zero-forcing beamforming and robust beamforming are considered. In the former case, the location of the eavesdropper is assumed to be known, whereas in the latter case, the location of the eavesdropper is unknown. Our numerical results show that the secrecy rate achieved by the TGN distribution is significantly improved as compared to those achieved by the truncated Gaussian and uniform distributions, for both zero-forcing beamforming and robust beamforming. We also derive an upper bound on the achievable secrecy capacity that we used to assess the closeness of the achievable secrecy rates to the derived bound.},

abstract={To improve national security, government agencies have long been committed to enforcing powerful surveillance measures on suspicious individuals or communications. In this paper, we consider a wireless legitimate surveillance system, where a full-duplex multi-antenna legitimate monitor aims to eavesdrop on a dubious communication link between a suspicious pair via proactive jamming. Assuming that the legitimate monitor can successfully overhear the suspicious information only when its achievable data rate is no smaller than that of the suspicious receiver, the key objective is to maximize the eavesdropping non-outage probability by joint design of the jamming power, receive and transmit beamformers at the legitimate monitor. Depending on the number of receive/transmit antennas implemented, i.e., single-input single-output, single-input multiple-output, multiple-input single-output, and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), four different scenarios are investigated. For each scenario, the optimal jamming power is derived in a closed form and efficient algorithms are obtained for the optimal transmit/receive beamforming vectors. Moreover, low-complexity suboptimal beamforming schemes are proposed for the MIMO case. Our analytical findings demonstrate that by exploiting multiple antennas at the legitimate monitor, the eavesdropping non-outage probability can be significantly improved compared with the single-antenna case. In addition, the proposed suboptimal transmit zero-forcing scheme yields similar performance as the optimal scheme.},

abstract={We investigate the spectrum sharing possibility as an incentive to enhancing the physical layer security. The concept behind this is that a legitimate source-destination pair, communicating in the presence of a passive eavesdropper, stimulates the help of another source-destination node looking for transmission opportunities, referred to as secondary network (SN). We thus propose a cooperative scheme, whereby the secondary transmitter will act as a friendly jammer to confound the eavesdropper and be granted to share the spectrum of the legitimate pair, referred to as primary network (PN), as a reward. To evaluate the performance of our cooperative scheme, we derive the closed-form expression of the secrecy outage probability (SOP). However, to assess its usefulness, we introduce the mutual outage probability (MOP) and we carry out analysis to derive its expression. We show that a satisfactory SOP is a necessary condition for triggering the cooperation, whereas a satisfactory MOP is a sufficient condition to guarantee that the PN-SN collaboration leads to a win-win situation. Results have been presented considering outdated channel state information, thus giving more insights for practical setups.},

abstract={Mobile cloud computing enables mobile devices such as smartphones to offload data to clouds via access points or base stations to reduce energy consumption and improve their user experience. However, mobile offloading is vulnerable to smart attackers that can exploit software defined radios to perform multiple types of attacks, such as spoofing and jamming, based on the status of radio environments and the offloading process. In this paper, a mobile offloading game against smart attacks, in which a mobile device chooses its offloading rate, a smart attacker chooses the type of its attack, and a security agent decides whether to initiate full data protection for the offloading, is investigated. The interactions among a mobile device, a smart attacker and a security agent are formulated as a secure mobile offloading game. The Nash equilibrium (NE) and its existence conditions are provided for the static secure offloading game. A Q-learning based mobile offloading strategy is proposed for dynamic environments to address smart attacks, in which the mobile device is unaware of the system parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed offloading strategy improves both the offloading rate and the security performance.},

abstract={Frequency jamming is known as an efficient attack tool to disrupt wireless communication. This efficiency can also be exploited for the benefit of a network-an idea often referred to as friendly jamming. A prominent application case is the blocking of unauthenticated or malicious communication, such as injection attacks. In this paper, we propose access points as a natural place to implement friendly jamming functionality. We analyze this proposal using simulations, introduce an implementation on customer-grade access points, and report measurement results from the first real-world study of friendly jamming in an IEEE 802.11 campus network. We discover a fundamental tradeoff between the effectiveness of friendly jamming and the orthogonal aspect of having minimal side-effects to the campus network's traffic. In particular, we observed what we call the power amplification phenomenon. This effect aggravates the known hidden station problem when the number of jammers increases. We also find evidence that the collaboration between jammers can enable friendly jamming, which is both effective and minimally invasive.},

abstract={Modern wireless systems and standards increasingly rely on OFDM for high-throughput communications. However, these systems are often highly vulnerable to selective jamming attacks, particularly when a jammer targets (part of) the known frame preamble. In this paper, we consider one of the most disruptive jamming attacks against the preamble-based frequency offset (FO) estimation in IEEE 802.11a/n/ac/ax systems and develop four techniques to mitigate this attack. Two of these techniques are based on randomly changing the first half of the standard frame preamble at the transmitter while maintaining its backward compatibility with legacy receivers. Specifically, we design a set of new preamble waveforms that satisfy the expected characteristics of a preamble in 802.11 systems. The other two techniques take a receiver-based approach and exploit the parts of the preamble that are not under attack to estimate the FO. We conduct extensive simulations and illustrative USRP experiments to study the effectiveness of these countermeasures.},

abstract={Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation has found its way to a wide range of applications. Much attention has been paid to study different techniques for AoA estimation and its applications for jamming suppression, however, security vulnerability issues of AoA estimation itself under hostile activity have not been paid the same attention. In this paper, the problem of AoA estimation in Rician flat fading channel under jamming condition is investigated. We consider the scenario in which a receiver with multiple antenna is trying to estimate the AoA of the specular line of sight (LOS) component of signal received from a given single antenna transmitter using a predefined training sequence. A jammer equipped with multiple antennas is trying to interrupt the AoA estimation phase by sending an arbitrary signal. We derive the optimal jammer and receiver strategies in various scenarios based on the knowledge of the opponent strategies and the available information about the communication channel. In all scenarios, we derive the optimal jammer signal design as well as its optimal power allocation policy. The results show the optimality of the training based Maximum Likelihood (ML) AoA estimator in case of randomly generated jamming signal. We also show that, the optimal jammer strategy is to emit a signal identical to the predefined training sequence turning the estimation process into a highest power competition scenario in which the detected AoA is the one for the transmitting entity of higher power. The obtained results are supported by the provided computer simulation.},

abstract={We unveil the existence of a vulnerability in Wi-Fi, which allows an adversary to remotely launch a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack that propagates both in time and space. This vulnerability stems from a coupling effect induced by hidden nodes. Cascading DoS attacks can congest an entire network and do not require the adversary to violate any protocol. We demonstrate the feasibility of such attacks through experiments with real Wi-Fi cards, extensive ns-3 simulations, and theoretical analysis. The simulations show that the attack is effective both in networks operating under fixed and varying bit rates, as well as ad hoc and infrastructure modes. To gain insight into the root-causes of the attack, we model the network as a dynamical system and analyze its limiting behavior. The model predicts that a phase transition (and hence a cascading attack) is possible when the retry limit parameter of Wi-Fi is greater or equal to 7, and characterizes the phase transition region in terms of the system parameters.},

abstract={We investigate the physical layer security in cooperative wireless networks where a source (Alice) transmits a confidential message to a destination (Bob) with the help of a cooperative node (Charlie), in the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve). Cooperative transmission is explored to secure communication between Alice and Bob, while ensuring the desired quality of service (QoS) at Charlie's receiver. We provide a transmit design for outage constrained secrecy rate maximization, taking both security and QoS constraints into account. Unlike the conventional cooperative security that adopts a fixed transmission scheme, we propose a mechanism for transmit strategy adaptation with security protection. Specifically, the proposed cooperative transmission is replaced by a cooperative jamming scheme if either security or QoS constraint is not satisfied. Numerical results confirm that our design enables dynamic transmission, and thus is flexible and environment-adaptive.},

abstract={Because of opportunistic spectrum access, cognitive radio networks is a promising solution for spectrum scarcity problem. In cognitive radio networks, users need to communicate through control channels in order to cooperate for sharing sensing information, channel sharing and spectrum management. As a result control channels security is of a great importance. If control channels get jammed, network's performance degrades dramatically; therefore, the jammers primary target in cognitive radio networks is to demolish control channels in order to disturb the network's performance. Traditionally hopping sequences were used to battle this problem but considering cognitive radio networks intelligence, dynamic spectrum access and learning algorithms all can be hired to confront jammer. In this paper, by using game theoretic concepts, stochastic games and by defining states, actions and players' reward, we introduce a stochastic game with multiple users to make control channels resilient against sweep attacks. Win or Learn Fast (WoLF) Q learning algorithm has been used to solve the designed game and variable learning rate are used to make sure that the designed game converges. By simulation we show that in the presence of dynamic channel variations and imperfect sensing the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing ones in terms of jammer resistivity.},

Unlike the conventional approaches, CCRN features both communicator and jamming nodes in a friendly coalition to take joint actions against hostile networking entities. In particular, this paper showcases hypothetical blue force and red force CCRNs and their competition for open spectrum resources. We present state-agnostic and stateful solution approaches based on the decision theoretic framework. The state-agnostic approach builds on multiarmed bandit to develop an optimal strategy that enables the exploratory-exploitative actions from sequential sampling of channel rewards. The stateful approach makes an explicit model of states and actions from an underlying Markov decision process and uses multiagent Q-learning to compute optimal node actions. We provide a theoretical framework for CCRN and propose new algorithms for both approaches. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithms outperform some of the most important algorithms known to date.},

To study the network properties under follower jamming, network simulations are performed. The investigated networks in a flat terrain become more jammed than the corresponding networks in a hilly terrain. The packet delivery ratio is measured when the network protocol OLSR MPR-flooding is used and compared with a network using full flooding. Even if not as robust as full flooding, we show that OLSR MPR-flooding is still relatively robust.

abstract={Denial-of-service attacks launched by malicious jammers can pose significant threats to infrastructure-less wireless networks without a centralized controller. While significant recent research efforts have dealt with such attacks and several possible countermeasures have been proposed, little attention has been paid to the idea of cooperative anti-jamming. Inspired by this observation, this paper proposes and studies a cooperative anti-jamming scheme designed to enhance the quality of links degraded by jammers. To achieve this objective, users are allowed to cooperate at two levels. First, they cooperate to optimally regulate their channel access probabilities, so that jammed users gain a higher share of channel utilization. Second, users leverage multiple-input single-output cooperative communication techniques to enhance the throughput of jammed links. The problem of optimal cooperative anti-jamming is formulated as a distributed pricing-based optimization problem, and a best-response algorithm is proposed to solve it in a distributed way. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves considerable gains (compared with traditional non-cooperative anti-jamming) especially under heavy traffic or high jamming power. Furthermore, the proposed distributed algorithm is shown to achieve close-to-global optimality with moderate traffic load.},

abstract={An adaptive cooperative scheme is proposed to improve the security of a wireless-powered relay network. A source node sends data to a destination node in the presence of an amplify-and-forward untrusted relay node and an alien eavesdropper where both are assumed to attempt to decode the source’s information signal. The source uses a fraction of its transmit power to send a jamming signal to keep its information confidential. To save energy, the energy-harvesting relay node transmits with the minimum power level that ensures secure transmissions. We derive a closed-form upper bound on the system’s secrecy outage probability. The proposed cooperative scheme is more efficient than the conventional scheme, where once the relay has accumulated sufficient energy, it assists the source’s information transmission.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider a wireless powered communication network with an energy harvesting (EH) jammer where eavesdroppers try to wiretap the communication between users and a hybrid access-point (H-AP). In our system, the H-AP first transmits an energy signal to recharge the batteries of the EH users and the EH jammer in the energy transfer (ET) phase. Then, in the subsequent information transfer (IT) phase, each user sends information to the H-AP in a time division multiple access manner, while the jammer generates jamming signals to interfere the eavesdroppers. We adopt two different secrecy performance measurements according to the level of channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdroppers. First, with a single user, we maximize the secrecy rate by optimizing the time allocation between the ET and the IT phase when perfect CSI of the eavesdroppers is available at all nodes. In contrast, when the instantaneous CSI of the eavesdroppers is not available at legitimate nodes, we analyze and minimize the secrecy outage probability. We also extend the single user analysis to a more general multi-user situation with an additional consideration of the transmit power allocation at the jammer. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed solutions through simulations and demonstrate that a performance gain compared to conventional schemes becomes more pronounced with the increased number of eavesdroppers and users.},

We investigate the optimal strategy for spoofing, desynchronizing, and jamming a cluster-based CR network with a Gaussian noise signal over a slow Rayleigh fading channel. The adversary can limit access for secondary users (SUs) by either transmitting a spoofing signal in the sensing interval, or a desynchronizing signal in the code acquisition interval. By jamming the network during the transmission interval, the adversary can reduce the rate of successful transmission. We show how the adversary can optimally allocate its energy across subcarriers during sensing, code acquisition, and transmission intervals. We determine a worst-case optimal energy allocation for spoofing, desynchronizing, and jamming, which gives an upper bound to the received video distortion of SUs. We also propose cross-layer resource allocation algorithms and evaluate their performance under disruptive attacks.},

abstract={This paper investigates the physical layer security problem of cognitive decode-and-forward relay networks over Nakagami-m fading channels. We consider the relaying communication between one secondary user (SU) source and one SU destination by using an opportunistic relay selection from multiple SU relays and sharing the licensed spectrum of multiple primary users (PUs) in the underlay network. While the transmission between the SUs imposes interference on each PU, the relayed transmission is intercepted by one SU eavesdropper. In the absence of the eavesdropper's channel state information, the relay selection is based on the largest channel gain of relay-to-destination link, which is assumed to be outdated due to feedback delay. We derive the exact probability of non-zero secrecy capacity and the exact secrecy outage probability (SOP) in the closed form. Furthermore, we derive the asymptotic SOP in two different cases, and explicitly show the effects of system parameters on the secrecy diversity order and the secrecy diversity gain, respectively. Both asymptotic analysis and simulation results show that the secrecy performance can be improved by increasing either the number of relays or the Nakagami parameter of the legitimate relay channels, whereas the secrecy diversity gain deteriorates as the number of the PUs increases.},

abstract={This paper investigates the secrecy rate maximization problem for the multiple-input-single-output multiple-antenna-eavesdropper (MISOME) wiretap channel with multiple randomly located jammers. The multi-antenna base station (BS) transmits information signals along with artificial noise (AN) to disturb the eavesdropper. Moreover, the friendly jammers are properly selected to assist the legitimate link for better secure transmission with some payoffs. With this system model, we first formulate a Stackelberg game between the BS and the assisting jammers with full channel state information. Stackelberg equilibriums, including optimal fraction of transmit power for AN, optimal transmit power, and asking prices of assisting jammers, are first proved to exist and then analytically derived. A policy iterative algorithm is also proposed to obtain the optimal solutions. We then extend the Stackelberg game to the case of MISOME broadcast wiretap channel with channel distribution information of eavesdropper. Numerical results verify the accuracy of the derived results and the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The results reveal that the proposed jammer-assisted secure transmission can greatly improve the secrecy performance and meanwhile save more energy for information signals, which is significant for future wireless communication.},

abstract={This paper investigates the impact of the imperfect channel state information that is caused by the channel estimation errors on physical layer security. The investigation considers a dual-hop single amplify-and-forward (AF) based untrustworthy half/full-duplex bi-directional relay with a finite number of friendly jammers in the system model. According to Monte-Carlo simulation results, the channel estimation error causes system coding gain losses at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes both for half and full-duplex cases. Results also show that the CEE effects turn out to be at negligible levels in high SNR regimes. Results also show that friendly jammer, besides improving the secrecy performance of the system model, also degrades the curves and causes system coding gain losses at high SNR regimes. Results also show that better secrecy performance can be achieved when the relay terminal operates in full-duplex mode.},

abstract={Recent work has established that when transmitter Alice wishes to communicate reliably to recipient Bob without detection by warden Willie, with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels between all parties, communication is limited to O(√n) bits in n channel uses. However, this assumes that Willie has an accurate statistical characterization of the channel. When Willie has uncertainty about such and his receiver is limited to a threshold test on the received power, Alice can transmit covertly with a power that does not decrease with n, thus conveying O(n) bits covertly and reliably in n uses of an AWGN channel. Here, we consider covert communication of O(n) bits in n channel uses while generalizing the environment and removing any restrictions on Willie's receiver. We assume that an uninformed “jammer” is present to help Alice, and we consider AWGN and block fading channels. In some scenarios, Willie's optimal detector is a threshold test on the received power. When the channel between the jammer and Willie has multiple fading blocks per codeword, a threshold test on the received power is not optimal. However, we establish that Alice can remain covert with a transmit power that does not decrease with n even when Willie employs an optimal detector.},

abstract={Optimal relay selection is investigated for secure cooperative communications against an adaptive eavesdropper that can perform eavesdropping if the eavesdropping link has good channel quality or perform jamming otherwise. A number of decode-and-forward relays are available for legitimate communications, among which one relay can be selected to help. For legitimate communications, three cases for availability of the eavesdropping channel information are considered: full channel knowledge, partial channel knowledge, and statistical channel knowledge. An optimal relay selection scheme is proposed for each case. For the first and third cases, exact secrecy outage probability expressions in closed form are derived, and for the second case, an approximate secrecy outage probability is derived, which is tight in the high main-to-eavesdropper ratio regime. Moreover, secrecy diversity order for the proposed relay selection scheme in each case is also derived, which is shown to be a full secrecy diversity. Finally, numerical results are given to verify the theoretical analysis derived in this paper.},

abstract={This letter proposes a new efficient yet simple distributed ordered-based jamming scheme for securing a legitimate transmission and powering a wireless receiver equipped with a nonlinear energy harvester. A legitimate source node (Alice) communicates with one legitimate receive node (Bob) and one legitimate radio-frequency energy-harvesting node (Dana) in the presence of an eavesdropping node (Eve). A set of cooperative nodes (Jims) are deployed in the network to power Dana and secure the legitimate transmissions by jamming Eve. In each time slot, only one Jim is selected. Our proposed scheme does not require the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of Eve's links or the global CSI of the legitimate nodes at a legitimate central unit. The numerical results demonstrate that our scheme achieves higher average secrecy throughput than that achieved by the best-jammer scheme.},

abstract={The trustworthiness of nodes in a network is practically a complicated concept and strongly depends on the social relationship among the nodes. For a certain model of trustworthiness, the scheme can be optimized to achieve the highest average secrecy rate based on pre-defined information about possibly malicious nodes. In such a scheme, the secrecy rate is considered as a function of the maximum achievable rate (MAR) at the destination, the MAR at the malicious nodes and the corresponding probabilities. However, in some cases, the trustworthiness model is not available, for example, an engineer does not know if a certain node is maliciously eavesdropping, such a function cannot be derived. Consequently, we need to consider the performance of a scheme in a wide range of trustworthiness levels. To evaluate the performance for such a case, in this paper, we propose a novel concept for comparing these leaking rates which is called leaking rate region. We derive the closed form of leaking rate region for the case of two untrusted relays with multiple antennas at the source and the destination.},

abstract={In this paper, we study jamming attacks against wireless networks. Specifically, we consider a network of base stations (BSs) or access points (APs) and investigate the impact of a fixed number of jammers that are randomly deployed according to a Binomial point process. We investigate the network performance in terms of: 1) the outage probability and 2) the error probability of a victim receiver in the downlink of this wireless network. We derive analytical expressions for both these metrics and discuss in detail how the jammer network must adapt to the various wireless network parameters in order to effectively attack the victim receivers. For instance, we will show that with only 1 jammer per BS/AP: 1) the outage probability of the wireless network can be increased from 1% (as seen in the non-jamming case) to 80% and 2) when retransmissions are used, the jammers cause the effective network activity factor (and hence the interference among the BSs) to be doubled. Furthermore, we show that the behavior of the jammer network as a function of the BS/AP density is not obvious. In particular, a non-trivial behavior is seen, which indicates that the number of jammers required to attack the wireless network must scale with the BS density only until a certain value beyond which it decreases. In the context of error probability of the victim receiver, we study whether or not some recent results related to jamming in the point-to-point link scenario can be extended to the case of jamming against wireless networks. Numerical results are presented to validate all the theoretical inferences presented.},

Using the tools of stochastic geometry, we derive the expressions of connection probability and secrecy probability.

The performance impact due to adjacent channels interference (ACI) and a partial band noise jammer (PBNJ) are considered in the paper. In this paper, a Shaleh model is used to model the transponder traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA). This TWTA is protected by a soft limiter to prevent TWTA operation in the saturation region. Impact of signal clipping due to this soft limiter under a PBNJ is also investigated. Computer simulations are performed using Digital Video Broadcasting - Satellite - Second generation (DVB-S2) forward error correcting (FEC) codes.

Ground hub is required to estimate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and details of SNR estimation are also discussed in the paper.},

abstract={In this letter, we investigate the best antenna placement for eavesdroppers (Eves), who intend to wiretap information from the legitimate transmitter (Alice). Two configurations of co-located or distributed antennas (CA or DA) are compared to find the most harmful eavesdropper setting, which achieves higher average eavesdropping rate, i.e., the long-term leakage rate to Eves averaged over channel fading and random locations. For K → ∞, where K is the number of available antennas for Eves, we prove that without a guard zone (i.e., a geometric zone around Alice where Eves cannot be located in), DA Eves are more harmful, while with a nonzero guard zone, CA Eve is superior. For the finite-K case, we derive upper/lower bounds for the average eavesdropping rate. The bounds are then used to find a DA region, in which the DA Eves definitely outperform CA Eve. It is shown that this region depends on the value of K, the radius of the guard zone, and the jamming at Alice.},

abstract={We consider a broadcast channel in which a multi-antenna transmitter (Alice) sends K confidential information signals to K legitimate users (Bobs) in the presence of L eavesdroppers (Eves). Alice uses multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) precoding to generate the information signals along with her own (Tx-based) friendly jamming (FJ). Interference at each Bob is removed by MIMO zero-forcing. This, however, leaves a “vulnerability region” around each Bob, which can be exploited by a nearby Eve. We address this problem by augmenting Tx-based FJ (TxFJ) with Rx-based FJ (RxFJ), generated by each Bob. Specifically, each Bob uses self-interference suppression to transmit a friendly jamming signal, while simultaneously receiving an information signal over the same channel. We minimize the powers allocated to the information, TxFJ, and RxFJ signals under given guarantees on the individual secrecy rate for each Bob. The problem is solved for the cases when the eavesdropper's channel state information is known/unknown. Simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Furthermore, we discuss how to schedule transmissions when the rate requirements need to be satisfied on average rather than instantaneously. Under special cases, a scheduling algorithm that serves only the strongest receivers is shown to outperform the one that schedules all receivers.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a cooperative approach to improve the security of both primary and secondary systems in cognitive radio multicast communications. During their access to the frequency spectrum licensed to the primary users, the secondary unlicensed users assist the primary system in fortifying security by sending a jamming noise to the eavesdroppers, while simultaneously protect themselves from eavesdropping. The main objective of this paper is to maximize the secrecy rate of the secondary system, while adhering to all individual primary users' secrecy rate constraints. In the case of active eavesdroppers and perfect channel state information (CSI) at the transceivers, the utility function of interest is nonconcave and the involved constraints are nonconvex, and thus, the optimal solutions are troublesome. To solve this problem, we propose an iterative algorithm to arrive at least to a local optimum of the original nonconvex problem. This algorithm is guaranteed to achieve a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker solution. Then, we extend the optimization approach to the case of passive eavesdroppers and imperfect CSI knowledge at the transceivers, where the constraints are transformed into a linear matrix inequality and convex constraints, in order to facilitate the optimal solution.},

The jamming helper nodes are non-altruistic, and they gain access to the primary network by aiding in the confidential transmissions of the PU. We obtain the secrecy outage probability as a closed-form expression when PU and SUs have merely statistical information about the eavesdropper channel. For the delay-unlimited system, we derive the achievable confidential rates given the control strategies for bandwidth and power allocation. For the more practical delay-limited case, we formulate a network control problem with secrecy appearing as a Quality of Service (QoS) constraint optimizing the confidential and open transmission rates of the PU and SUs respectively. Finally, we develop a dynamic control algorithm obtaining asymptotically optimal solution and demonstrate its performance by numerical experiments.},

abstract={This letter proposes a novel dual user selection scheme for uplink transmission with multiple users, where a jamming user and a served user are jointly selected to improve the secrecy performance. Specifically, the jamming user transmits jamming signal with a certain rate, so that the base station (BS) can decode the jamming signal before detecting the secret information signal. By carefully selecting the jamming user and the served user, it makes the eavesdropper to decode the jamming signal with a low probability; meanwhile the BS can achieve a high receive signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore, the uplink transmission achieves the dual secrecy improvement by jamming and scheduling.

To further improve the system security, we propose beamforming-based cooperative jamming schemes subject to the availability of the channel state information (CSI) at the legitimate nodes. We assume that if a source node is not selected for data transmission, it is a cooperative jamming node. We impose an average transmit power constraint (averaged across time slots) on each source node. Hence, the source nodes should efficiently distribute their average transmit powers throughout the network operation between data and artificial noise transmissions to satisfy the QoS requirements. We investigate the two cases where a global CSI is assumed at the legitimate nodes and where there is no eavesdropper's CSI. The case where there is no CSI at the jamming nodes is also investigated and a new scheme is proposed. We derive closed-form expressions for the instantaneous secrecy rate for each scheme as well as the secrecy outage probability. Moreover, we derive the secrecy stable-throughput and delay-requirement regions of the network. Our proposed jamming schemes achieve significant increases in the secure throughput over existing schemes from the literature and over the no-jamming scheme.},

abstract={This paper presents the design for a prototype tactical dynamic spectrum access (DSA) mobile ad hoc network, where the network is organized into clusters operating on a single frequency. The frequency may be changed autonomously by the network in response to jamming or interference, after some frequency switching delay. The network node design is implementable on a software defined radio (SDR), such as the Nutaq PicoSDR. The contribution of this work is the prototype design and mapping of the design to the hardware and software architecture of the SDR, with a focus on the estimated delay in switching to a new frequency channel. The frequency switching delay is the result of systematic delays arising from the SDR platform, compounded by delays in the protocols enabling DSA, the gathering of sensing data from network nodes, and the dissemination of the frequency change command throughout the network.},

abstract={The complexity and sophistication of communications jamming will continue to increase over time. The traditional approach to jammer mitigation is to harden radios, often sacrificing communications performance for more advanced jamming protection. To provide an escape from this trend, we propose a jammer exploitation strategy in which the communications system causes an enemy reactive jammer to act as an unwitting relay. This can lead to an improvement in communications as a result of the jamming attack itself. The strategy proposed in this letter revolves around using a frequency-shift keying waveform that is tuned in such a way to exploit the jammer's behavior. We derive the channel capacity when using the waveform along with practical coding, and provide numerical results to gain insight.},

pages={168-173}, 
abstract={The ability to provide accurate spectrum sensing and decision making under an uncertainty environment is proving useful for the military SATCOM to increases the spectrum utilization. Dynamic spectrum access(DSA) allows a secondary user to access the spectrum holes that are not occupied by the primary users. However, the spectrum sensing for DSA is normally performed in a complex SATCOM environment under uncertainty, caused by the high GEO/LEO mobility, weak signals after a long distance of propagation, the high interference and jamming in an adversarial environment, etc. The uncertainty results in a high error probability in the spectrum sensing. In such a case, DSA requires a decision-making process to optimally determine which channels to sense and access. In this paper, we propose an approach for optimal spectrum sensing and decision making that mathematically models the uncertainty in the SATCOM while the whole system throughput is maximized. Specifically, we model the DSA with decision making as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) problem. Optimal DSA strategy has been discussed by an optimization process. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out and our simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed DSA strategy.},

abstract={The articles in this special section present the most recent advances in amateur drone surveillance network architecture and technologies. The advancement in communication, networking and sensing technologies has attracted researchers, hobbyists, and investors to deploy mini-drones, a.k.a. unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). Drones have boundless viable applications due to their small size and ability to fly without an on-board pilot such as in agriculture, surveillance, and numerous public services. The use of drones for achieving high speed wireless communication is one of the most significant applications for next-generation communication systems (5G). However, their deployment poses several public safety threats to national institutions such as atomic plants, historic places, and the homes of public officials because of their ability to carry explosives and other destructive chemicals. To cope with these security threats, the deployment of surveillance drones is required to monitor amateur drones. The main motivation of deploying surveillance drones is to keep an eye on amateur drones, which can cause serious disasters if no precautionary measures are taken on time. The increasing use of surveillance drones presents challenges such as robust detection, tracking, intruder localization, and jamming. The accuracy of detection is a basic requirement of the system. In general, accurate detection is time-consuming. In fact, a precise moving object detection method makes tracking more reliable and faster, and supports correct classification, which is quite important for surveillance drones to be successful.},

abstract={Jamming attack is one of the major threats in cognitive radio networks (CRNs). In this paper, we propose an anti-jamming channel hopping algorithm, Tri-CH, for CRNs. Tri-CH adopts random jump pattern (i.e., hops randomly over channels) to achieve high security level and reception mode stay pattern (i.e., stays at a channel for receiving packets only) to guarantee bounded time to rendezvous. Tri-CH operates without pre-shared secrets and role pre-assignment. Hence, Tri-CH is applicable to large networks, where nodes join and leave the network frequently, and may play the sender role and the receiver role, simultaneously. According to the theoretical analysis, Tri-CH outperforms in terms of maximum time to rendezvous under jamming attacks.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were initially developed for military monitoring and surveillance tasks but found several interesting applications in the civilian domain. A promising application/technology is to use drone small cells (DSCs) to expand wireless communication coverage on demand. Rapid deployment along with limited operating costs are key factors that boost the development of DSCs for both military and civilian utilizations. DSCs are rapidly deployable to provide connectivity for temporary users (e.g. attendees of festivals, sporting events, or seminars), or over disaster areas to replace damaged communication infrastructure. UAVs are battery-powered, which makes energy consumption optimization a critical issue for acceptable performance, high availability, and an economically viable DCS deployment. In this article we focus on the scheduling of beaconing periods as an efficient means of energy consumption optimization. The conducted study provides a sub-modular game perspective of the problem and investigates its structural properties. We also provide a learning algorithm that ensures convergence of the considered UAV network with its unique Nash equilibrium operating point. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical investigations to assist our claims about the energy efficiency of the strategic beaconing policy (at Nash equilibrium).},

abstract={Wireless sensor-actuator networks (WSANs) enhance the existing wireless sensor networks (WSNs) by equipping sensor nodes with actuators. The actuators work with the sensor nodes to perform application-specific operations. The WSAN systems have several applications such as disaster relief, intelligent building management, military surveillance, health monitoring, and infrastructure security. These applications require the capability of fast data dissemination in order to act responsively to events. However, due to strict resource constraints of the nodes, WSANs pose significant challenges in network protocol design to support applications with delay requirements. Biologically inspired modeling techniques have received considerable attention for achieving robustness, scalability, and adaptability, while retaining individual simplicity. Specifically, data dissemination, packet routing, and broadcasting protocols for wireless networks have been modeled by epidemic theory. However, existing bio-inspired algorithms are mostly based on predefined heuristics and fixed parameters, and thus it is difficult for them to achieve the desired level of performance under dynamic environments. In order to solve this problem, we propose an epidemic-inspired algorithm for data dissemination in WSANs which automatically controls node states to meet the delay requirements while minimizing energy consumption. Through mathematical analysis, behavior of the algorithm in terms of converge time and steady state can be predicted. Also, the analysis shows that the system achieves stability, and derives parameter conditions for achieving the stability. Finally, extensive simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme outperforms existing protocols in achieving delay requirements and conserving energy.},

abstract={Underwater acoustic (UWA) communications is the only reliable method for long-distance communications underwater, and is widely used in commercial, scientific, and military scenarios. However, the UWA channel is most challenging due to its double dispersion property in both long time delay and large Doppler spread, resulting in severe multipath spread and time variation. Among these, Doppler spread is one of the most critical challenges, and researchers have proposed various models in order to resolve Doppler spread in UWA channels. In this article, an overview of Doppler modeling and resolving is provided, divided into four stages: the quasi- static model of the mid-1980s, the uniform Doppler shift model in the 1990s, the basis expansion model and uniform path speed models of the late 1990s, and the recently developed non-uniform path speed model. Furthermore, the UWA channel sparsity property utilized by each of those models will also be discussed.},

abstract={Noncooperative classification of the modulation type of communication signals finds application in both civilian and military contexts. Existing modulation classification methods for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems commonly require a priori information on the number of transmit antennas employed by the multiantenna transmitter, which, in most of the noncooperative scenarios involving modulation classification, is unknown and needs to be blindly extracted from the received signal. Since the problems of MIMO modulation classification and detection of the number of transmit antennas are highly coupled, we propose a decision theoretic approach for spatial multiplexing MIMO systems that considers these two tasks as a joint multiple hypothesis testing problem. The proposed method exhibits a high performance even in moderate to low SNR regimes while requiring no a priori knowledge of the channel state information and the noise variance.},

Then, a deliberated interleaver is optimized for the new scheme. Thereafter, we introduce a strategy to estimate the minimum distance of the concatenation codeword, where an asymptotic performance and convergence behavior analysis are elaborated. Finally, the error performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated via simulations. The results show that our scheme almost outperforms all the existed concatenation ones using polar codes, making the codes more practical.},

abstract={Full-duplex (FD) cellular networks are considered in which an FD base station (BS) simultaneously supports a set of half-duplex (HD) downlink (DL) users and a set of HD uplink (UL) users. The transmitter and the receiver of the BS are equipped with reconfigurable antennas, each of which can choose its transmit or receive mode from several preset modes. Under the no self-interference assumption arisen from an FD operation at the BS, the sum degrees of freedom (DoF) of FD cellular networks is investigated for both no channel state information at the transmit side (CSIT) and the partial CSIT. In particular, the sum DoF is completely characterized for the no CSIT model and an achievable sum DoF is established for the partial CSIT model, which improves the sum DoF of the conventional HD cellular networks. For both no CSIT and partial CSIT models, the results show that the FD BS with reconfigurable antennas can double the sum DoF even in the presence of user-to-user interference as both the numbers of DL and UL users and preset modes increase. It is further demonstrated that such DoF improvement indeed yields the sum rate improvement at the finite and operational signal-to-noise ratio regime.},

abstract={Successful execution of future network-centric military operations relies on effective enforcement of both need-to-know and responsibility- to-share principles. In modern military missions and coalitions, which have an increasingly agile character, a promising solution is to enforce security policies based on the properties of individual information objects - we call this approach content-based security. This article discusses the enforcement of content-based security policies at the different layers of the TCP/ IP model, and introduces a proof-of-concept implementation of a content-based protection and release mechanism in a software-defined networking environment. Our aim is to provide consistent enforcement of security policies across multiple system layers and multiple security dimensions (confidentiality, integrity, and availability). The results of an analysis of a concrete example of a software-defined network emulated in Mininet are encouraging and confirm the effectiveness of our approach with respect to improving protection of data in transit. The work presented in this article offers a basis for further research in this area.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network is widely applied in the traffic monitoring, remote sensing, search-and-rescue and military reconnaissance, and so on. In this letter, we have addressed the capacity and delay of UAV network with n UAVs that are intended to monitor three-dimensional environment such as air pollution, toxic gas leakage, and so on. We have derived the capacity and delay scaling laws of UAV network with mobility pattern information. Namely, when UAVs return to control station to charge battery, they can assist to deliver data for the UAVs along the returning path with a store-carry-and-forward (SCF) manner. Compared with traditional multi-hop transmission, the capacity of UAV network can be improved Θ((n/(log n))) times and the delay can be reduced Θ(((n/(log n)))1/3) times. Hence our research may motivate the application of SCF mode in UAV network.},

abstract={Battlefield networking (BN) considers each network entity as a network in itself, composed of several communication technologies usually interconnected by multiple satellites. In this context, we must consider the intrinsic properties of military contexts to apply SDN in BN to get more flexibility and programmability in network-centric operations. For instance, BN considers several communication technologies, as well as the distinct application requirements on the traffic transmitted over BN in terms of QoS and security features in dynamic environments, where flexible network-centric operations are mandatory. In this article, we define an SDBN architecture that adapts SDN technology to BN, enabling SDNbased applications, methods, and policies.

pages={6651-6661}, 
abstract={Satellite communications on the move (SOTM) systems are useful for many commercial and military applications, because they support network connectivity and mobility in very large geographical areas. However, SOTM systems suffer from channel blockage because of pointing errors of the antenna and shadowing by obstructions. This channel blockage reduces the network throughput. In this paper, we address a fully reliable application layer forward error correction (AL-FEC) mechanism for SOTM systems to enhance the network throughput. In particular, we propose an acknowledgement exchange protocol to ensure the reliability of the end-to-end data transfer as well as a transmission control scheme aided by navigation systems to enhance the resource efficiency in the AL-FEC mechanism. The proposed AL-FEC mechanism can predict channel blockage by utilizing navigation systems. The proposed mechanism then makes it possible to suspend the data transmission for the duration of the channel blockage. We also theoretically derive the file transfer time, the goodput, and the resource efficiency to justify the effectiveness of the proposed AL-FEC mechanism. The performance results show that the proposed AL-FEC mechanism can significantly enhance the goodput as compared with that of transmission control protocol. Furthermore, the resource efficiency is improved with the aid of the navigation systems.},

abstract={The Earth is a water planet, two-thirds of which is covered by water. With the rapid developments in technology, underwater wireless communications and networks have become a fast growing field, with broad applications in commercial and military waterbased systems. The need for underwater wireless communications exists in applications such as remote control in the off-shore oil industry, pollution monitoring in environmental systems, collection of scientific data from ocean-bottom stations, disaster detection and early warning, national security and defense (intrusion detection and underwater surveillance), as well as new resource discovery. Thus, the research into new underwater wireless communication techniques has played the most important role in the exploration of oceans and other aquatic environments. In contrast to terrestrial wireless radio communications, the underwater channel poses serious technical challenges depending on the communications modalities (e.g., acoustic, optical, or RF/magnetic) employed. These include, but are not limited to, ambient channel noise, severe attenuation, propagation delay, multipath, frequency dispersion, bio-fouling, lack of access to precise time synchronization (GPS), and constrained bandwidth and power resources. These challenges also provide an opportunity for design of hybrid and adaptive transmission, such as the underwater acoustic and optical communications and networks, which have somewhat complementary properties, with potential for longer range and higher bandwidth networked communications in size- and power-constrained modems and mobile unmanned systems.},

abstract={In this paper, we characterize the total degrees of freedom (DoFs) of the full-duplex asymmetric multiple-input multiple- output (MIMO) three-way channel. Each node has a separate-antenna full-duplex MIMO transceiver with a different number of antennas, where each antenna can be configured for either signal transmission or reception. We study this system under two message configurations; the first configuration is when each node has two unicast messages to be delivered to the two other nodes, while the second configuration is when each node has two unicast messages as well as one broadcast message to be delivered to the two other nodes. For each configuration, we first derive upper bounds on the total DoF of the system. Cut-set bounds in conjunction with genie-aided bounds are derived to characterize the achievable total DoF. Afterward, we analytically derive the optimal number of transmit and receive antennas at each node to maximize the total DoF of the system, subject to the total number of antennas at each node. Finally, the achievable schemes for each configuration are constructed. The proposed schemes are mainly based on zero-forcing and null-space transmit beamforming. We show that the derived outer and inner bounds on the total DoF are tight for each message configuration.},

pages={2327-2339}, 
abstract={Predictive resource allocations (PRAs) have recently gained attention in wireless network literature due to their significant energy-savings and quality of service (QoS) gains. This enhanced performance was primarily demonstrated while assuming the perfect prediction of both mobility traces and anticipated channel rates. While the results are very promising, several technical challenges need to be overcome before PRAs can be practically adopted. Techniques that model the prediction uncertainty and provide probabilistic quality of service (QoS) guarantees are among such challenges. This differs from the traditional robust optimization of wireless resources, as PRAs use a time horizon with predicted demands and anticipated data rates. In this paper, we tackle this problem and present an energy-efficient stochastic PRAs framework that is robust to prediction uncertainty under generic error probability density functions. The framework is applied for video delivery, where the desired video demands are modeled as probabilistic chance constraints over the prediction time horizon, and a deterministic closed form is then derived based on the Bernstein approximation (BA). In addition to handling prediction uncertainty, mechanisms that track the variance of the channel in real-time are practically needed. Towards this end, we demonstrate how a particle filter (PF) can be adopted to effectively achieve this functionality. A low complexity guided heuristic algorithm is also integrated with the BA-based allocations, and particle filter (PF), to provide a real-time solution. Extensive numerical simulations using a standard compliant long term evolution system are then presented to examine the developed solutions under various operating conditions. Results indicate the ability of our framework to significantly reduce base station energy consumption while satisfying users' QoS under practical prediction uncertainty.},

abstract={The feasibility conditions of interference alignment (IA) are analyzed for interfering broadcast-multiple-access channels in which one cell operates as downlink but the other cell operates as uplink. Under a general multiple-input and multiple-output antenna configuration, a necessary condition and a sufficient condition for one-shot linear IA are established, i.e., linear IA without symbol or time extension. In various example networks of interest, the optimal sum degrees of freedom (DoFs) are characterized by the derived necessary condition and sufficient condition. For symmetric DoF within each cell, a sufficient condition is established in a more compact expression, which yields the necessary and sufficient condition for a class of symmetric DoFs. An iterative construction of transmit and receive beamforming vectors is further proposed, which provides a specific beamforming design satisfying one-shot IA. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IA not only achieves larger DoF, but also significantly improves the sum rate over the single-cell operation in the practical signal-to-noise ratio regime.},

abstract={The sum degrees of freedom (DoFs) of L-cell multiantenna cellular downlink systems are studied. Each base station (BS) equipped with Mt transmit antennas sends independent messages to its K serving users equipped with Mr reconfigurable antennas, each of which can choose its receiving mode from N preset modes at each time. It is assumed that each BS and user only knows channel state information (CSI) of its own cell. A novel two-stage interference management scheme is proposed in which intra-cell interference is first nulled out by zero-forcing outer beamforming based on intra-cell CSI and inter-cell interference is then aligned by inner beamforming in a blind manner without inter-cell CSI. It is proved that, for Mt > K Mr and N > 1, the proposed scheme achieves an improved sum DoF compared with the conventional time division multiple access among cells. We further demonstrate that such DoF improvement yields an improved sum rate at the finite signal-to-noise ratio regime.},

From the nearly the dawn of radio technology, a pervasive theme has been the attempt to realize more bandwidth and capacity. The wide open spaces of 600- meter RF were soon crowded with interference, pushing communication links into shorter and shorter wavelengths and more creative channel utilization schemes. International regulatory bodies were quickly set up to deal with the situation and parcel out scarce spectrum among far too many requesters. Wireless spectrum usage has been the scene of constant change ever since, with primary, secondary, and tertiary users jockeying for access to every Hertz of RF channel. All this was mostly of interest to military and commercial interests — satellite operators, transportation companies, long-haul providers, and so on — until the 1990s, when cellular technology and, later, wireless LANs started taking off. The advent of widespread personal wireless communication meant that there was a lot more competition for spectrum from a lot more people, and heretofore “unattractive” blocks of spectrum suddenly became quite valuable real estate.},

pages={145-151}, 
abstract={In recent years, there has been a large push in the U.S. Department of Defense to move to an all-IP infrastructure, particularly on the tactical edge. IP and associated protocols were designed primarily for wired networks tied to fixed infrastructure. Although extensions to support MANET have received decades of research, in practice, there are few successful implementations. Challenges include handling mobility, managing lossy links, and scaling to large numbers of users. Unfortunately, these are the exact conditions military tactical edge networks must operate within: high mobility, high loss, and large numbers of users. To address the needs and particular challenges of military tactical edge information sharing requirements, we consider a new class of networking approaches called group-centric networks that focuses on dynamic and resilient formation of interest groups. The structure of tactical networks limits the majority of collaboration and network traffic to within a group of users that share a set of common interests (i.e., platoons, 4-ships, etc.). These groups are formed either prior to the mission or on the fly with only a minor amount of traffic flowing outside of these groups. Group-centric networking approaches can help connect users in military tactical edge networks. In addition, we also discuss an instantiation of a group-centric network protocol called Group Centric Networking (GCN), compare GCN against a traditional MANET routing approach on a 90-node Android mobile phone testbed, and discuss implications for tactical edge users.},

abstract={Spectrum is limited, but the demand for it is growing steadily with new users, applications, and services in both commercial and tactical communications. The current paradigm of static spectrum allocation cannot satisfy this demand, resulting in a congested, contested environment with poor spectrum efficiency. Tactical radios need to share spectrum with other in- and out-of-network tactical and commercial radios, subject to potential jamming and other security attacks. Cognitive radio provides tactical communications with new means of spectrum sharing, cohabitation configurability, and adaptation to improve communication rates, connectivity, robustness, and situational awareness, all translated to network- centric mission success. A systematic solution to SDR programming and test and evaluation (T&E) is needed to address spectrum challenges with the network-centric mission success set as the primary goal. Once equipped with cognitive radio capabilities, tactical radios can quickly and reliably discover the white-space and effectively use spectrum opportunities across time, space, and frequency. This article presents the design and implementation of a visual and modular radio software programming tool that supports easy, fast, and radio-agnostic development of cognitive radio and network protocols and security mechanisms. This tool is fully integrated with a unified T&E framework that applies the same SDR solution to high fidelity simulation and emulation tests under a common, controllable, and repeatable scenario. This unified approach makes prototyping of cognitive radio capabilities with tactical radios faster, easier, and cost-effective.},

abstract={The high energy efficiency for cognitive sensor network (CSN) has been widely studied for supporting various applications in military and civil fields. By identifying time fraction, local detection threshold, and the number of cognitive sensors, we discuss some design considerations for a cluster-based collaborative spectrum sensing scheme. We formulate the optimization problem to maximize energy efficiency of CSN under a collision constraint and false alarm probability constraint. In order to overcome the problem of finding the optimal detection threshold when k-out-of-M fusion rule is used by the sink node (SN), we design a fictitious cognitive sensor (FCS), which has the same sensing performance as SN. The process for finding the optimal local detection threshold can be converted into the process for searching an optimal received SNR of FCS. Theoretical analysis shows that there exists a unique time fraction to maximize the energy efficiency. Finally, our theoretical analysis is verified through numeric simulations.},

abstract={Network-centric warfare is a no-way-back trend in modern military operations. The application of this concept ranges from upper-level decision making echelons to troop guidance on the battlefield, and many studies have been carried out in this area. However, most of these are concerned with either the higher-level strategic networks, that is, the networks linking the higher echelons with abundant resources, satellite communications, or even a whole network infrastructure, or high-end TEN, representing resource-rich troops in the field, with military aircraft, battleships, or ground vehicles equipped with powerful wireless communication devices and (almost) unrestricted energy resources for communication. However, these studies fail to take into account the "last-mile TEN," which comprises resource constrained communication devices carried by troopers, equipping sensor nodes deployed in the field or small unmanned aerial vehicles. In an attempt to fill this gap in the studies on battlefield networking, this article seeks to combine software-defined and delay-tolerant approaches to support the diverse range of strict requirements for applications in the last-mile TEN.},

abstract={Cross-domain information exchange is an increasingly important capability for conducting efficient and secure operations, both within coalitions and within single nations. A data guard is a common cross-domain sharing solution that inspects the security labels of exported data objects and validates that they are such that they can be released according to policy. While we see that guard solutions can be implemented with high assurance, we find that obtaining an equivalent level of assurance in the correctness of the security labels easily becomes a hard problem in practical scenarios. Thus, a weakness of the guard-based solution is that there is often limited assurance in the correctness of the security labels. To mitigate this, guards make use of content checkers such as dirty word lists as a means of detecting mislabeled data. To improve the overall security of such cross-domain solutions, we investigate more advanced content checkers based on the use of machine learning. Instead of relying on manually specified dirty word lists, we can build data-driven methods that automatically infer the words associated with classified content. However, care must be taken when constructing and deploying these methods as naive implementations are vulnerable to manipulation attacks. In order to provide a better context for performing classification, we monitor the incoming information flow and use the audit trail to construct controlled environments. The usefulness of this deployment scheme is demonstrated using a real collection of classified and unclassified documents.},

This allows us to support more ubiquitous vehicles, achieve better communication efficiency, and address limitations in conventional vehicular networks in terms of latency, location awareness, and real-time response (typically required in smart traffic control, driving safety applications, entertainment services, and other applications). Such requirements are particularly important in adversarial environments (e.g., urban warfare and battlefields in the Internet of Battlefield Things involving military vehicles).

The Communications Society has decided not to use Computer Modern fonts in their publications. the degrees of freedom (DoF) of cellular networks in which a full duplex (FD) base station (BS) equipped with multiple transmit and receive antennas communicates with multiple mobile users. We consider two different scenarios. In the first scenario, we study the case when half duplex (HD) users, partitioned to either the uplink (UL) set or the downlink (DL) set, simultaneously communicate with the FD BS. In the second scenario, we study the case when FD users simultaneously communicate UL and DL data with the FD BS. Unlike conventional HD only systems, inter-user interference (within the cell) may severely limit the DoF, and must be carefully taken into account. With the goal of providing theoretical guidelines for designing such FD systems, we completely characterize the sum DoFs for both FD cellular networks. The key idea of the proposed scheme is to carefully allocate UL and DL streams using interference alignment and beam forming techniques. By comparing the DoFs of the FD systems with those of the conventional HD systems, we show that the DoF can approach the two-fold gain over the HD systems, when the number of users becomes large enough compared with the number of antennas at the BS.},

year={2018},

pages={1374-1388}, 
abstract={Recent research on predictive video delivery promised optimal resource utilization and quality of service (QoS) satisfaction to both dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) providers and mobile users. These gains were attained while presuming an idealistic environment with perfect predictions. Thus, a robust QoS-aware predictive-DASH (P-DASH) is of paramount importance to handling the practical uncertainty implied in predicted information. In this paper, we propose a stochastic QoS-aware robust predictive-DASH (RP-DASH) scheme over future wireless networks that takes into account imperfect rate predictions. The objective is to achieve long-term quality fairness among the DASH users while capping the probability of service degradation by an operator predefined level. A deterministic formulation is then obtained using the scenario approximation, which adopts the probability density function (PDF) of predicted rates. A linear conservative approximation is introduced to provide an NP-complete formulation, which can be optimized by commercial solvers. Since exact PDF might not be available, Gaussian approximation is adopted by the introduced scheme to provide a closed form less complexity formulation. To support real-time implementations, a guided heuristic algorithm is devised to obtain near-optimal resource allocations and quality selections, while satisfying the predefined QoS level. Previous non-robust P-DASH schemes are evaluated in this paper, while considering typical error models in predicted rates. Such schemes resulted in increased QoS and the quality of experience degradations with the network load, which was avoided by the introduced RP-DASH. Results further revealed the ability of RP-DASH to reach optimal and fair QoS satisfactions.},

title={Impact of Heterogeneous Fading Channels in Power Limited Cognitive Radio Networks}, 
year={2018}, 
volume={4}, 
number={1}, 
pages={1-14}, 
abstract={The tradeoff between decreasing the interference to primary user (PU) and increasing secondary users’ (SUs’) achievable throughput is an important problem in cognitive radio networks. Heterogeneous fading channels from PU to multiple SUs, PU’s traffic distribution, limited SU’s power and multiple SUs’ access contention impact both these two conflicting objectives. In this paper, we study the joint impact of these four factors on the tradeoff. More specifically, we consider that the channels from PU to SUs are exposed to non-identically independent free space path losses, PU’s traffic randomly arrives and departs from the channel, every SU’s average power consumption is limited, while multiple SUs contend to transmit. We first model the impact of these factors on SUs’ spectrum sensing and data transmission. Then, we formulate the tradeoff aiming at maximizing SUs’ aggregated throughput under two constraints: 1) interference probability to PU and 2) SUs’ average power consumption. To solve the optimization problem, we design a novel cluster based particle swarm optimization (C-PSO) algorithm. By iteratively updating the particles in a cluster based on the comparison of their fitnesses, the cluster converges to the optimal solution rapidly. Simulation results validate the feasibility of the C-PSO algorithm and the outperformance of our proposal compared against related contributions which consider the homogeneous fading channel. They also show how the optimal solution varies with path losses and PU’s traffic distribution.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider an amplify-and-forward-based two-way relaying network, in which the relays need to harvest energy from the received radio frequency signals to remain active in the network and assist data exchange between two transceivers. In particular, considering time-switching architecture, we investigate the problem of joint energy harvesting (EH) time allocation and distributed beamforming in the presence of interference. Specifically, assuming that the perfect knowledge of the interfering links is not available, we study three different design approaches. First, we maximize the sum-rate of the network subject to individual EH power constraints at relays. Resorting to the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and successive upper-bound minimization techniques, we devise an iterative algorithm that efficiently solves such a challenging problem. Next, we minimize the total power consumed by the relays subject to the rate constraints at the transceivers. Finally, we minimize the EH-phase duration subject to the individual EH power constraints at the relays as well as the rate constraints at the transceivers. The rate constraints, however, make both second and third design optimization problems non-convex and complicated. Although no closed-form solutions are available for these approaches, we propose efficient schemes by applying the SDR technique followed by semi-definite programming problems.},

This article surveys the prospects of exploiting the emerging FD radio technology in military communication applications as well. In addition to enabling high-rate twoway tactical communications, the STAR capability could give a major technical advantage to armed forces by allowing their radio transceivers to conduct electronic warfare at the same time that they are also receiving or transmitting other signals at the same frequency bands. After comprehensively introducing FD transceiver architectures and SIC requirements in military communications, this article outlines and analyzes all the most promising defensive and offensive applications of the STAR capability. It is not out of the question that this disruptive technology could even bring about a paradigm shift in operations at the cyber-electromagnetic battleground.

abstract={The problem of identifying the channel code from a received sequence of noise-affected codewords is known as the blind reconstruction of channel codes. Blind reconstruction of channel codes is an important problem in military surveillance applications to identify the channel code used by an adversary. In this paper, we consider the problem of the blind reconstruction of the binary cyclic codes of unknown length from an unsynchronized bitstream (i.e., when the location of codeword boundaries is not known). For the blind reconstruction of cyclic codes, it is sufficient to identify the correct synchronization, the length, and the factors of the generator polynomial of the code. Toward this, we study the distribution of the syndromes (remainders) of the received polynomials with respect to a candidate factor of the generator polynomial. We prove that the probability of zero syndrome is maximum when all the parameters are correct. Using this result, the problem of the blind reconstruction of cyclic codes is formulated and solved as a hypothesis testing problem.},

abstract={Signal identification has emerged as an enabling technology for intelligent wireless communication systems with applications in military and commercial fields. One of recent trends in this research topic is to propose identification algorithms for multiple antenna (MA) systems with multi-carrier (MC) transmissions. The previously reported investigations are limited to space-time block code (STBC) systems with MC transmissions. However, practical systems include also space-frequency block code (SFBC) schemes with MC transmissions. In this paper, we develop and analyze an SFBC identification algorithm for MA orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission for the first time in the literature. Analytical expressions for the time-domain properties of the Alamouti and spatial multiplexing SFBC-OFDM signals are derived as the basis of the identification process. The proposed algorithm is divided into two steps. The first step estimates the cross-correlation function of pairs of signals received from different antennas, while the second step employs a false-alarm based test for decision making. The proposed algorithm avoids the need for a priori knowledge of the modulation format, channel coefficients, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) value, and the starting time of OFDM symbols. Simulation results show the ability of the proposed algorithm to provide an acceptable identification performance in the presence of transmission impairments, even at relatively low SNR values. These favorable results are achieved with acceptable computational cost.},

It also presents a case study that envisages a scenario in which drones operate alongside conventional wireless infrastructure, thereby allowing a greater number of users to establish a line-of-sight link for communication. This study investigates a power allocation strategy for the microwave base station and the small base stations operating at 28 GHz frequency band. The self-adaptive power control strategy for drones is dependent on the maximum allowable interference threshold and minimum data rate requirements. This study highlights the importance of incorporating the drones in the multi-tier heterogeneous network to extend the network coverage and capacity.},

It remains the responsibility of human Network Operations Centre (NOC) operators to oversee and manage the running of the network, where their main task is to respond to huge numbers of messages, errors, warnings and faults constantly flowing from the managed network. In the past, network operators either employed expert systems or became very dependent on expert knowledge of their operational staff. Considering the current explosion in size and complexity of managed telecoms network, it is widely understood and accepted that current manual and semiautomated approaches cannot scale. In this paper we investigate the applicability of recommender systems as an approach to assist NOC operators to correctly respond to indications of incidents in the network they are actively managing.},

abstract={Tactical cloudlets are forward-deployed, discoverable, virtual-machine-based servers that can be hosted on vehicles or other platforms to provide a computation offload and data staging infrastructure for mobile devices in the field. Because of the mobility of cloudlets in the field, as well as dynamic missions, a mobile user of a cloudlet might need to migrate active capabilities (computation and data) to another trusted cloudlet. A common solution for establishing trust between two nodes is to create and share credentials in advance, and then use a third-party, online trusted authority to validate the credentials of the nodes. However, the characteristics of tactical environments do not consistently provide access to that third-party authority or certificate repository because they are DIL environments (disconnected, intermittent, limited). The goal of this paper is to present a solution for secure VM migration between tactical cloudlets based on secure key generation and exchange in the field.},

abstract={Personnel operating in tactical environments heavily rely on information sharing to perform their missions. Solutions deployed in these environments need to focus on reliability and performance, in addition to usability to work as unattended as possible due to the often chaotic nature of operations. In this paper we propose a solution for delay-tolerant data sharing, in particular file sharing, using well supported, common networking protocols. The solution is based on the concept of broadcatching, which combines a delay-tolerant protocol such as BitTorrent with a publish/subscribe mechanism such as RSS to enable “many to one” information sharing. Experimental data shows that it is a promising approach for enabling reliable, mostly unattended data sharing on tactical networks in tactical environments.},

The contribution of this work is the prototype design and mapping of the design to the hardware and software architecture of the SDR, with a focus on the estimated delay in switching to a new frequency channel. The frequency switching delay is the result of systematic delays arising from the SDR platform, compounded by delays in the protocols enabling DSA, the gathering of sensing data from network nodes, and the dissemination of the frequency change command throughout the network.},

abstract={Efficient network communications are essential to enable network-centric warfare. However, tactical edge networks present an extremely challenging and heterogeneous networking environment due to heterogeneous architectures, dynamic topologies, unwanted adversarial behavior, interference, and other wireless channel conditions. In order to support end-user applications and guarantee system performance and interoperability in such constrained environments, it is critical to adapt the volume and type of traffic generated by applications to the continuously varying network conditions. To this end, we extended the Agile Computing Middleware (ACM) with capabilities specifically designed to provide network state detection and adaptation in constrained networks. In this paper, we present SENSEI (for Smart Estimation of Network StatE Information), a set of components of the ACM that provides effective strategies for the dissemination of network state information. SENSEI implements a content- and context-aware clustering-based algorithm for the distribution of network state information that can significantly reduce the overhead associated with network state information sharing.},

The signal is relayed over a nonlinear distorted satellite transponder. The transponder is modelled to include a gain element, a soft limiter, and a travelling wave tube amplifier (TWTA); a Shaleh model is used to model the TWTA. The outage probability is determined when the probability of the mutual information random variable is less than the code rate. The outage probability is used as a theoretical bound for maximum capacity. This bound serves as an important benchmark of the achievable rate for the RL. The degree in which M-ary phased shift keying (MPSK) signals using Digital Video Broadcasting - Satellite - Second generation (DVB-S2) forward error correction (FEC) with numerous code rates to achieve this bound is investigated by computer simulation, and also discussed in the paper.},

abstract={Mobile tactical networks (MTNs) in military communications extend the capabilities of mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs). The MTNs are dynamic, infrastructureless, self-forming and self-healing systems designed for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) operations using multi-hop relaying. Unlike their commercial counterparts, MTNs have to offer much higher levels of security, jamming resistance, and service robustness in the adverse propagation environments without sacrificing or limiting data rate, latency, and node mobility while also controlling the network capital and operational costs. Comprehensive comparison of the performance and design characteristics of the commercial MANETs and their military counterparts is carried out using NS2 simulations. It is found that, for scenarios requiring long-range connectivity, a reference point group mobility (RPGM) model and a two-way ground radio propagation model give the most accurate performance predictions for MTNs. Finally, it is argued that many commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies can be adopted for their use in MTNs, even though it requires a lot of additional efforts to overcome challenges not considered by the commercial solutions.},

abstract={Spectrum is limited, but the demand for it is growing steadily with new users, applications, and services in both commercial and tactical communications. The current paradigm of static spectrum allocation cannot satisfy this demand, resulting in a congested, contested environment with poor spectrum efficiency. Tactical radios need to share spectrum with other in- and out-of-network tactical and commercial radios, subject to potential jamming and other security attacks. Cognitive radio provides tactical communications with new means of spectrum sharing, cohabitation configurability, and adaptation to improve communication rates, connectivity, robustness, and situational awareness, all translated to network- centric mission success. A systematic solution to SDR programming and test and evaluation (T&E) is needed to address spectrum challenges with the network-centric mission success set as the primary goal. Once equipped with cognitive radio capabilities, tactical radios can quickly and reliably discover the white-space and effectively use spectrum opportunities across time, space, and frequency. This article presents the design and implementation of a visual and modular radio software programming tool that supports easy, fast, and radio-agnostic development of cognitive radio and network protocols and security mechanisms. This tool is fully integrated with a unified T&E framework that applies the same SDR solution to high fidelity simulation and emulation tests under a common, controllable, and repeatable scenario. This unified approach makes prototyping of cognitive radio capabilities with tactical radios faster, easier, and cost-effective.},

This article surveys the prospects of exploiting the emerging FD radio technology in military communication applications as well. In addition to enabling high-rate twoway tactical communications, the STAR capability could give a major technical advantage to armed forces by allowing their radio transceivers to conduct electronic warfare at the same time that they are also receiving or transmitting other signals at the same frequency bands. After comprehensively introducing FD transceiver architectures and SIC requirements in military communications, this article outlines and analyzes all the most promising defensive and offensive applications of the STAR capability. It is not out of the question that this disruptive technology could even bring about a paradigm shift in operations at the cyber-electromagnetic battleground.

abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel distributed deadline-based routing and spectrum allocation algorithm for tactical ad-hoc networks. The proposed algorithm will enable nodes to adapt to various deadline requirements unique to each traffic classes. A tactical ad-hoc network needs to handle a variety of data flowing through the network including voice, surveillance video, threat alert among others. Each of these traffic classes may have different quality of service (QoS) based deadline requirements. It is critical to receive these packets before the deadline expires to make crucial decisions in the battlefield. Therefore, the network should be able to adapt to these requirements and maximize the effective throughput. Accordingly, a distributed deadline-based routing and spectrum allocation algorithm is designed to maximize the utilization of the available resources to ensure delivery of packets within the deadline constraints. The simulations show up to 35 % improvement in effective throughput and 26 % improvement in reliability as compared to the routing and spectrum allocation algorithm (ROSA).},

The whole facilitated by the spread of Software-Defined Radios (SDR) in tactical radios. We have implemented our architecture in a proof of concept and tested it with 2 tactical scenarios. Our experiments show that centralizing the intelligence in the MEC allows to guarantee the requirements of the tactical applications either by adapting the waveform parameters, or through changing the radio interface or even by reconfiguring the applications. More generally, the best decision can be seen as the optimal reaction to the wireless links variations.},

abstract={Tactical Edge Networks are one of the most challenging communication environments, where node mobility, constrained devices, and the wide use of wireless ad hoc channels for communications cause frequent link disruption and network partitioning. Additionally, applications running in Tactical Edge Networks often follow one-to-many and many-to-many communication models that require the nodes' cooperation to enable data delivery. Many studies proposed the use of peer-to-peer systems in mobile ad hoc networks to remove any dependency on centralized nodes and to cope with link disruptions and network partitioning phenomena that derive from the extreme dynamicity of Tactical Edge Networks. In this paper, we compare the performance of file sharing in mobile ad hoc networks using an implementation of the BitTorrent peer-to-peer protocol and DisService, a middleware for information dissemination specifically designed for Tactical Edge Networks. DisService supports applications with routing and peer-to-peer content delivery in mobile ad hoc networks.

abstract={Tactical Edge Networks provide one of the most challenging communication environments. In order to cope with node mobility, constrained resources, and link unreliability, communication solutions designed for Tactical Edge Networks typically present highly configurable interfaces to be adaptable for various networking conditions. However, the extreme dynamicity and heterogeneity of tactical scenarios call for network-aware, adaptive communication systems that continuously re-tune their configuration parameters to match the ever-changing network conditions. This paper presents the Dynamic Detect and Adapt Mechanism (DDAM) of the Agile Communication Middleware, a distributed solution to perform network monitoring and communication adaptation specifically designed for Tactical Edge Networks. The present work focuses on two components of the DDAM: NetSensor, which provides efficient monitoring of the network status, and NetSupervisor, which is responsible for characterizing the network technology used to connect a pair of nodes in the network. The presented results show that our solution can accurately identify the technology used to establish links between nodes.},

pages={503-508}, 
abstract={Proximity-based malware, such as cyber cellphone worms and trojans, has been identified to be one of the serious open threats to wireless networks operating at the tactical edge. The ability of malware to exploit the vulnerabilities of a wireless mobile platform is often a function of the mix of software and hardware which define its platform. In this paper, we utilize a proactive strategy which takes advantage of platform diversity metrics to defend against cyber worm attacks in tactical networks. This strategy uses dynamic K-Distance pruning to minimize the total number of shared edges between nodes with similar platforms while retaining access to mission-critical services. To achieve this we introduce a new neighborhood diversity metric and show how it can be used to limit the spread of malware in a multi-platform mobile network by reducing contact between machines with similar vulnerabilities. We test our assumptions via an agent-based simulation of epidemic malware in a synthetic tactical network.},

abstract={In the practical Disconnected, Intermittent, and Limited-bandwidth (DIL) network environment at the tactical edge, warfighters have to be able to efficiently transmit data between each other to ensure rapid situational response to the surrounding environment. To tackle with the intermittent wireless network connectivity in the DIL environment, the “carry-and-forward” approach has been adopted to exploit warfighters' mobility and physically relay the data upon contacts with each other, but its performance relies on accurate prediction of warfighters' contacts with each other. In this paper, we present a novel probabilistic framework that is able to ensure accurate prediction of warfighters' contacts by considering both initial deployment information and in-situ contact patterns of warfighters at the tactical edge. Analytically models are developed to depict the characteristics of both aspects and are then integrated towards a Bayesian-based probabilistic inference framework. Evaluation results over practical DIL network traces show that our approach can dramatically increase the accuracy of contact prediction and further improve the performance of data forwarding in the DIL network environment at the tactical edge.},

abstract={Protected tactical waveform (PTW) provides cost-efficient, jamming-resistant communications via both government and commercial satellites over multiple frequency bands such as the C-, Ku-, Ka-, and X-band. Frequency hopping (FH) was originally developed for secure communications by exploiting time-frequency diversity over a large spectrum. The anti-jamming feature of the frequency hopping technique helps communication systems improve the reliability of transmission. In this paper, we consider a secure channel group hopping (CGH) scheme in order to satisfy the needs of protected tactical satellite communication system. This scheme is proposed to ensure that each channel group hops to a new hopping spectrum in a pseudo-random manner during each hopping period, and different channel groups always transmit over non-overlapping frequency bands. Our analysis suggests that the proposed CGH scheme achieves collision-free frequency hopping among channel groups, such that a higher spectrum efficiency of the system can be obtained. Simulation results are provided to validate the performance of the proposed CGH scheme for PTW system.},

abstract={Disruption/Delay tolerant networking (DTN) is a promising solution to mitigate the effects of periodic link outages that last seconds to minutes, which are prevalent in high capacity airborne tactical networks that are directional in nature and highly affected by aircraft body blockage. There are several considerations for applying the DTN Bundle Protocol (RFC 5050) in tactical edge networks which have ciphertext/plaintext boundaries resulting in multiple deployment options: 1) black-side DTN tunnel, 2) red-side DTN interface, 3) red-side DTN proxy, and DTN-enabled applications. Each of these approaches have benefits and limitations. In this paper, we present a DTN proxy implementation that can work on both red or black sides of tactical edge networks and show test results that help us better understand the capability of the approach, its limitations, and in what circumstances it is most appropriate. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, we show that TCP file transfer speed can be increased by up to 143.39% and 218% for two-hop and three-hop aerial backbone networks respectively when each link suffers 25% independent outage.},

In this paper, a Shaleh model is used to model the transponder traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA). This TWTA is protected by a soft limiter to prevent TWTA operation in the saturation region. Impact of signal clipping due to this soft limiter under a PBNJ is also investigated. Computer simulations are performed using Digital Video Broadcasting - Satellite - Second generation (DVB-S2) forward error correcting (FEC) codes. In addition, a ground hub receiver does not assume knowledge of the channel information. Ground hub is required to estimate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and details of SNR estimation are also discussed in the paper.},

The battlefield where these equipment are deployed includes a majority of coalition communication. Each group on the battleground may communicate with other members of the coalition and establish inter-MANETs links. Operational communications tend to provide tactical ad hoc networks some capacities. There is a better broadband radio in UHF band (ex: NATO - 225-400 MHz) and some heterogeneous services such as voice or video (ex: capture from a drone) are provided. Several Network-layer protocols have been proposed in order to handle inter-domain routing for tactical MANETs. In this paper, we present a coalition context and describe the functional hypothesis we used. Then, we propose a protocol that would fit such a network and conduct experimentation that tend to show that our proposition is quite efficient.},

abstract={In ongoing efforts, our team has developed DISCO (Distributed Cross-layer Architecture for Network Awareness and Opportunistic Transport), a cross-layer framework to enable network awareness and automated adaptation of transport, network and application parameters in a MANET. DISCO automates discovery of new applications and services, and applies rule-based logic and machine learning to enable the network to better meet application's performance requirements or for applications to adjust their requirements. DISCO also supports legacy applications using proxies to maintain backward compatibility. Our DISCO broker collects cross layer information, shares it in a distributed manner to guide new transport and network-layer adaptation methods. In this paper, we present an overview of DISCO and introduce a new TCP variant called TCP-Derwood-Lite that benefits from DISCO's design and provides performance comparable to the original TCP-Derwood. Unlike other TCP variants that operate on per packet microsecond timescales, Derwood-Lite operates on a per-second timescale in the user space, and still provides significant performance benefits in wireless networks with path or link switches. Our EMANE emulation experiments on engineering and tactical scenarios with as many as 23 mobile nodes in an OLSR MANET show 2X performance gains over TCP Reno and TCP Westwood, comparable to TCP Derwood but with much lower processing requirements.},

abstract={Since the near-far problem is expected to be a significant issue in the context of tactical communications, the tolerable amount of adjacent channel interference (ACI) is an important design requirement. We describe a numerical simulator which has been developed in order to evaluate the level of ACI arising in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) in the VHF band when a large number of nodes and radio networks must coexist. The simulator is based on a simplified system model and on an existing path loss model derived from channel measurements in different environments. Monte-Carlo simulations have been performed over a large number of independent static snapshots of the system and results have been compared to the performance of some binary continuous phase modulation (CPM) schemes. It turns out that the impact of ACI on the system is strongly dependent on the density of nodes within the operation scenario and the number of total available channels.},

OLP has an evolution stage which involves the direct use of cryptography in this context, called Cryptographic Access Control. Using next-generation public-key encryption techniques called attribute-based encryption (ABE), RBAC policies may be directly encoded into encrypted objects and their respective key material. While attractive in theory, there is only little research on the performance impact of using different ABE solutions to determine their applicability in variety of military situations, for example tactical setups and military evolution stages of Internet-of-Things. Additionally, many of the early ABE schemes are lacking in their security model. Later schemes remedy these models, but with an additional impact in performance. In this paper, we will investigate the performance impact of using ABE with real-life military policies in the OLP context, both with proposed basic security model (selective security) ABE and newer full security ABE schemes. The investigation is performed by experimenting with existing ABE software libraries, such as PBC and Charm. We present both relative and absolute measures of bandwidth and computational performance of two, OLP-compatible ABE schemes.},

abstract={In mission critical networks, nodes need to communicate with minimum delay and loss. This calls for routing protocols that can quickly and efficiently route the application traffic to their destinations. This paper proposes a distance-based routing protocol, named as Smallworld, which finds efficient routes to target nodes often through a very short chain of intermediate nodes, without using any routing table like other standard routing protocols. This protocol exploits the “small-world” phenomenon of social networks where source-destination pairs typically get connected through few intermediate friends and the individuals can collectively discover such short paths. The key idea behind this routing protocol is that for forwarding an incoming packet to the destination, a node picks the next hop from between a one-hop neighbor, from its one-hop neighborhood that is closest to the destination, and a randomly selected long-distance neighbor, i.e., from outside of its one-hop neighborhood, based on which of these two neighbors is closer to the destination. This simple but effective algorithm can meet mission performance objectives by reducing packet losses, end-to-end delays, hop-counts, connectivity drops and control overheads in many tactical scenarios of interest.},

abstract={Network coding has been proven to be an effective technique to increase the throughput and enhance robustness of various wireless networks including tactical heterogeneous wireless networks. Usually, the tactical heterogeneous wireless networks consist of different wireless links including high bandwidth links like IEEE 802.11 and low bandwidth links like UHF and VHF. Load balancing is an effective way to mitigate the network loading and improve overall performance of heterogeneous network. Traditional flow-based load balancing scheme performs poor and has a negative effect when applying network coding in tactical heterogeneous wireless networks. How to enhance the performance of network coding over tactical heterogeneous network is worthy of research. In this paper, with full consideration of different channel propagation characteristics and distinct transmission demands of different packets in a single stream, we propose a packet-based load balancing scheme, making appropriate use of highly unbalanced links by transmitting different types of packets on different channels. By making full use of the propagation characteristics of low bandwidth channels, our scheme can significantly shorten the end to end delay of feedback packets and improve the transmission reliability of feedback packets. Compared with flow-based load balancing, our scheme can reduce 63.47% of the redundant transmissions on average and achieve 15.53% improvement of throughput.},

abstract={In recent years, there has been a large push in the U.S. Department of Defense to move to an all-IP infrastructure, particularly on the tactical edge. IP and associated protocols were designed primarily for wired networks tied to fixed infrastructure. Although extensions to support MANET have received decades of research, in practice, there are few successful implementations. Challenges include handling mobility, managing lossy links, and scaling to large numbers of users. Unfortunately, these are the exact conditions military tactical edge networks must operate within: high mobility, high loss, and large numbers of users. To address the needs and particular challenges of military tactical edge information sharing requirements, we consider a new class of networking approaches called group-centric networks that focuses on dynamic and resilient formation of interest groups. The structure of tactical networks limits the majority of collaboration and network traffic to within a group of users that share a set of common interests (i.e., platoons, 4-ships, etc.). These groups are formed either prior to the mission or on the fly with only a minor amount of traffic flowing outside of these groups.

abstract={Tactical wireless sensor networks (WSN) consist of power constrained devices spread throughout a region of interest to provide data extraction in real time. The main challenges to the deployment of tactical WSNs for mission-centric operations are limited nodal energy and information security. In this paper we develop security mechanisms to be implemented on a tactical WSN using the 6LoWPAN protocol for use by the United States Marine Corps (USMC). Specifically, we develop an architectural framework for tactical WSNs by studying security gaps and vulnerabilities within the 6LoWPAN security sublayer which is based on IEEE 802.15.4. We develop a key management scheme that is non-broadcast but that is also feasible in an operational scenario. In addition, we modify the 6LoWPAN packet structure to facilitate the newly developed keying mechanism. The tactical WSN architecture is designed to defend against a variety of network attacks that can potentially occur. Simulations will be conducted via MATLAB to show the effectiveness of the developed keying and communication mechanisms.},

abstract={We consider video transmission over a mobile cognitive radio (CR) system operating in a hostile environment where an intelligent adversary tries to disrupt communications. We investigate the optimal strategy for spoofing, desynchronizing, and jamming a cluster-based CR network with a Gaussian noise signal over a slow Rayleigh fading channel. The adversary can limit access for secondary users (SUs) by either transmitting a spoofing signal in the sensing interval, or a desynchronizing signal in the code acquisition interval. By jamming the network during the transmission interval, the adversary can reduce the rate of successful transmission. We show how the adversary can optimally allocate its energy across subcarriers during sensing, code acquisition, and transmission intervals. We determine a worst-case optimal energy allocation for spoofing, desynchronizing, and jamming, which gives an upper bound to the received video distortion of SUs. We also propose cross-layer resource allocation algorithms and evaluate their performance under disruptive attacks.},

abstract={Usually ridged waveguides, log periodic and tapered slot antennas have been extensively used for EW applications. In this paper, design of a multi-octave band tapered slot Vivaldi antenna (62 mm × 31 mm × 1.6 mm) operating in the frequency band of 6–18 GHz is proposed. Various antenna characteristics such as return loss, VSWR, effective gain and radiation patterns are measured. In addition, the responses of the antenna are studied through parametric study for different values of exponential tapering rate (R), slot width (W3)and cavity diameter (ri). The simulation results show that the VSWR increases at higher value of R resulting in poor performance of the antenna. The simulated value of antenna gain at selected frequencies of 6 GHz, 10 GHz, 12 GHz and 18 GHz are 3.2 dB, 7.3 dB, 7.8 dB and 0.4 dB, respectively. The antenna is fabricated using FR4 substrate and measured results are compared with simulation results. It is shown that the simulated results agree well with the measured results. The antenna is designed using HFSS software and concluding remarks are reported.},

year={2017},

pages={592-598}, 
abstract={The enterprise and tactical domains have distinct properties and requirements, and have thus evolved independently in incompatible ways. Today the network infrastructure has emerged to, in theory, enable interconnectivity between these domains at a global scale. Unfortunately, even in the presence of these communication capabilities and despite the benefits that each operational domain can gain from access to information held by the other, warfighters at the tactical edge and analysts in enterprise agencies continue to lack meaningful, realtime access to each other's information. The separate evolution of the two domains has led to clients that use different forms of identification and access control, systems that employ different applications and use different data formats, and networks that operate most efficiently under different protocols. To address these differences and the need to meaningfully bridge enterprise and tactical domains, we are developing a framework for Robust Operational Gateways Enabling Reachback/Reach-forward (ROGER). ROGER attempts to address the hard problems inherent in connecting disparate clients, services, and networks over potentially unreliable communication substrates, in a manner that not only enables connectivity where none was present before, but in a way that enables efficient, effective, safe, and reliable information discovery and sharing. Acknowledging the plurality of types and structures of networks, services, applications, and missions, ROGER provides a gateway framework rather than a specific gateway. This framework supports building gateways that enable safe reach-back and reach-forward across a large set of heterogeneous networks and systems. By enabling the selection and configuration of pluggable, context specific components, ROGER supports the instantiation of gateways customized for particular deployments. Multiple gateways can be chained to provide reach-back and reach-forward across widely different and geographi- ally dispersed networks.},

pages={611-616}, 
abstract={Future tactical communications involves high data rate best effort traffic working alongside real-time traffic for time-critical applications with hard deadlines. Unavailable bandwidth and/or untimely responses may lead to undesired or even catastrophic outcomes. Ethernet-based communication systems are one of the major tactical network standards due to the higher bandwidth, better utilization, and ability to handle heterogeneous traffic. However, Ethernet suffers from inconsistent performance for jitter, latency and bandwidth under heavy loads. The emerging Time-Triggered Ethernet (TTE) solutions promise deterministic Ethernet performance, fault-tolerant topologies and real-time guarantees for critical traffic. In this paper we study the TTE protocol and build a TTTech TTE test bed to evaluate its performance. Through experimental study, the TTE protocol was observed to provide consistent high data rates for best effort messages, determinism with very low jitter for time-triggered messages, and fault-tolerance for minimal packet loss using redundant networking topologies. In addition, challenges were observed that presented a trade-off between the integration cycle and the synchronization overhead. It is concluded that TTE is a capable solution to support heterogeneous traffic in time-critical applications, such as aerospace systems (eg. airplanes, spacecraft, etc.), ground-based vehicles (eg. trains, buses, cars, etc), and cyber-physical systems (eg. smart-grids, IoT, etc.).},

abstract={Today, rapid business and technology innovations are producing an array of advanced commercial satellite communications (COMSATCOM) systems that can deliver massive amounts of SATCOM capacity at a fraction of current cost and offer communications diversity that is critical for achieving resilience in a military contested environment. Recognizing the alignment of commercial capabilities with the Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for high capacity, global coverage, lower cost, and resilience, the department is proactively engaging the industry to formulate strategies leading towards a DoD Wideband SATCOM Enterprise that efficiently acquires and effectively manages advanced commercial capabilities in its architecture. To fully leverage the expanded space resources, the DoD must also address the integration of commercial waveforms into the DoD tactical terminals. The terminal flexibility for operating across multiple operator networks, in multiple frequency bands, and support different waveforms/modems is not only a pre-requisite for accessing advanced services but also key in providing resilience against threats. The purpose of this paper is to provide an architectural overview of the flexible terminal and Flexible Modem Interface (FMI) concepts. The FMI enables managed terminal flexibility and should be considered as an important step in converging DoD tactical terminal segment capabilities for various types of satellite networks and managed services.},

abstract={Previous work on machine learning for intrusion detection in mobile tactical networks using the extremely lightweight intrusion detection (ELIDe) system has shown that ELIDe can approximate signature-based intrusion detection using significantly less resources and power than the traditional intrusion detection system without significantly degrading accuracy. ELIDe also performs binary classification and multiclass classification on various malware that Snort cannot detect. In this paper, we demonstrate how ELIDe identifies malware within network traffic based on partially trained malware signature patterns that have significant weighted values within the classifier's weight vector. Our experiments trained ELIDe with malware signatures and network traffic without the presence of malicious traffic, and we were able to obtain the common partial patterns between the two different data sets. Based on knowledge of the common partial patterns that exist between true-negative and true-positive results from our experiments, we show that ELIDe can improve its false-positive rate without significantly affecting its false-negative rates.},

pages={846-851}, 
abstract={There are two broad safety related message categories in vehicular networks: emergency and periodic messages that should share the scarce wireless resource simultaneously. Emergency messages deliver time-critical information with guaranteed reliability, e.g., road-safety information, whereas periodic ones convey normal status update information, e.g., vehicular positions, that is less time- and loss-critical. Recent studies on efficient Medium Access Controls (MACs) under these requirements propose to use the IEEE 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) protocol with a strict priority. In this paper, we first model this protocol by a coupled embedded markov chain, and consider an optimization problem that requires to jointly characterize delivery probability and delay of those two types of messages. Our characterization of delivery probability and delay using the modeled embedded Markov chain enables one to easily find the right protocol parameters that satisfy given requirements of emergent and periodic messages, providing a useful engineering value in running the MAC protocol over vehicular networks. We conduct extensive simulations to validate our analytical findings, which we believe is of broad interest to an environment consisting of emergent and periodic message transmissions such as tactical networks with drones.},

abstract={We investigate adaptive transmission for tactical packet radio networks in which a source uses fountain coding to multicast a file to a number of destinations over time-varying links. We examine two strategies from the literature for packet-by-packet adaptation of the modulation and channel code. The maximum data-recovery rate philosophy attempts to maximize the throughput for each transmitted packet. It can employ control information derived from practical receiver statistics. The weighted completion time approach minimizes a function of the expected file-delivery delays at the destinations and uses control information derived from perfect channel-state information and knowledge of the number of packets received by each destination. We devise a minimax completion time protocol that uses the same control information as the weighted completion time approach but applies the minimax criterion to the expected delays to select transmission parameters for each packet. Performance comparisons are given for a number of different multicast networks in which each link experiences correlated Rayleigh fading.},

abstract={This paper studies the problem of routing in a multilayer (communication and social) network. Network protocols, such as link state routing and its variants, heavily used in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) cannot sustain robustness and efficiency as the topological information becomes easily stale with fast network dynamics. Attempts to collect and exchange excessive network information would result in significant overhead and would degrade the overall network performance. This paper presents the SCATE (Social-Cognitive Advancement at Tactical Edge) routing protocol that applies social-cognitive techniques to improve robustness and efficiency of a multilayer network with MANET communication and social links. In a distributed and decentralized setting with local information, nodes learn and update their distances to destinations using social-cognitive metrics and make routing decisions to minimize the end-to-end delay. The SCATE protocol is compared with Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) with and without social links. Stand-alone computer simulations and high fidelity simulation/emulation tests with CORE and EMANE are used to evaluate SCATE under different communication network (traffic and mobility) and social network effects. Results show that the SCATE protocol is a viable solution to MANET routing by substantially reducing the overhead and the end-to-end delay, and increasing the end-to-end delivery ratio for both unicast and multicast traffic.},

abstract={Real-time data from ground-based surveillance systems form the basis for current air traffic control procedures in the terminal and en route regions of today's National Airspace (NAS). Current air traffic control procedures, used by controllers, employ tactical methods to manage the separating and sequencing of aircraft. Crossing restrictions are a commonly-used component of tactical control. The use of crossing restrictions causes sub-optimal, level-altitude flight segments for extended distances, which results in excess fuel burn, excess flight duration, and higher airline operating costs. Design and use of uninterrupted climb and descent profiles will recover the lost operating costs. This work employed flight track data and a heuristic algorithm to estimate the magnitude of the lost operation costs. We estimated the impact of level-altitude flights on aircraft operating at airports in the New York City (NYC) area (e.g., EWR, JFK, LGA Airports) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2015. In FY2015, 200,000 minutes (3,333 hrs) and 10 million kg (3.3 M gal) fuel were lost due to use of level-altitude procedures for aircraft operations at the NYC-area airports. The study provides estimates of the burden of level-altitude flight sections for aircraft that operated in FY2015 at other major terminal radar approach control (TRACON) facilities in the US: Atlanta (A80), Charlotte (CLT), Chicago (C90), Dallas-Ft Worth (D10), and Northern California (NCT). For the TRACONS studied in this work, the estimated penalty of level-altitude operations is 930,000 minutes (15,500 hrs) and 61 million kg (20 M gal) fuel per year.},

abstract={During a disaster incident, existing network infrastructures might either be damaged or overloaded. However, disaster operations require real-time and low latency data communication, especially live video and audio streaming, as well as in integration with social networks. Thus, deployed tactical networks face several challenges to connect intervening teams. To date, there is still a lack of routing standards for such networks. Indeed, in such harsh environment, medical rescue teams, firefighters, military, police and even victims need to be steadily connected to a distant command center (CC) which conducts the rescue operations. In our recent works, a new routing protocol called ORACE-Net was proposed, evaluated and compared to the existing approaches. ORACE-Net aims to create a tactical Internet of Humans (IoH) emergency network. ORACE-Net is implemented on mobile devices and evaluated within realistic conditions. The complete proposed solution consists of the CROW2, an Internet of Humans-based platform for disaster relief and emergency communication. In this paper we describe the setup and the demonstration of the CROW2 platform based on the our conducted experimentation.},

abstract={In recent years, we have observed a resurgence of DDoS attacks. These attacks often exploit vulnerable servers (e.g., DNS and NTP) to produce large amounts of traffic with little effort. However, we have also observed the appearance of application-level DDoS attacks, which leverage corner cases in the logic of an application in order to severely reduce the availability of the provided service. In both cases, these attacks are used to extort a ransom, to hurt a target organization, or to gain some tactical advantage. As it has happened for many of the components in the underground economy, DDoS has been commoditized, and DDoS as a service (DaaS) providers allow paying customers to buy and direct attacks against specific targets. In this article, we present a measurement study of 17 different DaaS providers, in which we analyzed the different techniques used to launch DDoS attacks, as well as the infrastructure leveraged in order to carry out the attacks. Results show a growing market of short-lived providers, where DDoS attacks are available at low cost (tens of dollars) and capable of easily disrupting connections of over 1.4 Gb/s. In our study, particular attention was given to characterize application-level (HTTP) DDoS attacks, which are more difficult to study given the low volume of traffic they generate and the need to study the logic of the application providing the target service.},

abstract={A key property in tactical network environments is that the wireless network itself is typically the major limiting factor in how much information can be shared between users. In such environments, tactical operations often employ group communication protocols (one-to-many or many-to-many) to send information between users. This often results in situations where every message sent gets delivered to everyone on the network which can lead to network congestion, performance degradation, application failure, and even complete information loss. In light of today's computationally rich mobile devices, it is preferential to expend additional processing power to limit the messages being sent to only those required by interested clients rather than to simply deliver every message to every client. This paper summarizes the results of a research effort to explore and implement an Information Management (IM) prototype known as BANDIT that enables efficient and reliable information exchange across a swarm of Android devices within a decentralized Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network. BANDIT features a lightweight implementation of the Kademlia algorithm for P2P swarm management, and implements an efficient broadcast algorithm designed for minimal cost internode communication within structured P2P networks. BANDIT provides decentralized publish/subscribe IM services that, in contrast to more traditional IM systems, have no reliance on a centralized server (which requires additional dedicated hardware and poses the risk of being a single point of failure). Instead, BANDIT IM services are provided by each of the devices participating in the swarm. BANDIT is interoperable with traditional client-server based IM systems which further enables information sharing across tactical and strategic elements.},

abstract={In recent years, there has been a large push in the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to more rapidly respond and adapt to changing technology advancements and emerging threats. Nowhere is an accelerated pace of innovation more needed than in the airborne tactical domain where the predominant communication system, Link 16, has been in use for over 40 years. Airborne tactical systems are often stove-piped, highly integrated, and designed to be hardware-specific, making insertion of new technology at the component level extremely challenging. To resolve these limitations, DARPA has been exploring an architecture which separates the transceiver from the waveform processors from the application processors [1]. Each of these processors can be programmed with composable waveform blocks that can be chained together dynamically to leverage the available apertures to perform different missions from communications, SIGINT, electronic warfare, and others. As part of the effort, many of the current generation of airborne tactical waveforms were ported to the new architecture. In this paper, we describe some lessons learned in developing hardware-agnostic, composable, software communications blocks as a proof of concept of the modular new architecture.},

abstract={The United States Department of Defense (DoD) is contemplating the use of commercial technologies such as 4G/LTE (Long Term Evolution) for tactical edge communications because of several benefits offered by them. However, the greatest hindrance to the adoption of LTE for military communications is its lack of support to combat the presence of malicious jamming. In this paper, we propose an anti-jamming technique based on electronic null steering that can be used in tactical communications. We first develop a simple model for the proposed anti-jamming method, and use it to gain insights into the performance improvements gained from the technique. We provide extensive simulations to support the claims from the model. Finally, we describe implementation of the technique on an FPGA platform and highlight some of the challenges involved.},

year={2016}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={694-699}, 
abstract={A prime objective in tactical environments is reliable, ad hoc communication among multiple users robust to lapses in coordination methods such as GPS or centralized base stations. Classical approaches to multi-user communications relying on tight node synchronization and/or power control are infeasible in ad hoc infrastructure-poor scenarios. In this paper, we study multi-user coding strategies with greatly reduced synchronization requirements (compared to conventional systems such as cellular) ideally suited for mobile near-ground nodes in harsh tactical environments. We exploit quasi-synchronous (QS) direct sequence (DS) code division multiple access (CDMA) codes transmitted over multiple carriers (MC). These codes are characterized by a zero cross-correlation zone (ZCZ), a measure of the delay tolerance among transmitters over which perfect code orthogonality still holds at the receiver. Using multiple carriers extends the ZCZ in time, thereby relaxing the time synchronization requirement, but tightening the frequency synchronization requirement. We study this tradeoff in this paper. We also argue that the QS MC-DS-CDMA system will have superior performance at lower VHF because of reduced multipath, reduced frequency offset, and better penetration relative to UHF or microwave systems in dense urban environments [1]-[4]. We develop an experimental testbed based on software-defined radios (SDR) and analyze the proposed approach at the lower VHF band.},

abstract={This paper presents experimental verification of the performance of Group Centric Networking (GCN), a networking protocol developed for robust and scalable communications in lossy networks where users are localized to geographic areas, such as military tactical networks. Initial simulations in NS3 showed that GCN offers high delivery with low network overhead in the presence of high packet loss and high mobility. We extend the investigation to verify GCN's performance in actual over-the-air experimentation. In the experiments, we deployed GCN on a 90-node Android phone test bed distributed across an office building, allowing us to evaluate its performance over-the-air on real-world hardware. GCN's performance is compared against multiple popular wireless routing protocols, which we also run over-the-air. These tests yield two notable results: (1) the seemingly benign environment of an office is in fact quite lossy, with high packet error rates between users that are geographically close to one another, and (2) that GCN does indeed offer high delivery with low network overhead, which is in contrast to traditional wireless routing schemes that offer either high delivery or low overhead, or sometimes neither.},

year={2016}, 
volume={},

pages={1207-1212}, 
abstract={Ensuring secure command and control in a tactical military environment is vital as the combat forces face many potentially sophisticated adversaries who seek out the vulnerabilities in the communications infrastructure. Although authentication schemes has been substantially explored, the ability of new techniques to coexist with existing system (i.e., legacy systems) is often overlooked. The objective of this work is to establish feasibility of a physical (PHY) layer authentication technique that can be implemented easily to coexist with legacy systems. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of a PHY layer authentication scheme that can seamlessly integrate within systems containing legacy receivers, which do not have the ability to decode PHY layer authentication tags. To this end, we design and evaluate a quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) and π/4 Differential quadrature phase shift keying (DQPSK) based authentication schemes and demonstrate their operation with legacy as well as non-legacy receivers. The addressed authentication scheme follows constellation perturbation by a pre-determined angle which performs the tag embedding without incurring additional network bandwidth. The implementation and evaluation platform consists of a software defined radio (SDR) testbed by using the open source radio framework, GNU Radio, and Universal Software Radio Peripherals (USRP-N210s). For moderate to high signal-to-noise ratios, the QPSK tagging scheme achieves low (<;10-4) bit error rates (BER) and tag error rates (TER); this is due to a novel phase locked loop (PLL) design. The use of forward error correction (FEC) on the tag is also considered, and an improved TER and power saving is demonstrated. Results from our wireless SDR experiments validate the mechanism and demonstrate the practicality of the approach.},

Evaluated on realistic propagation and radio models in typical deployment scenarios, the approach has very little overhead and provides fast route convergence to meet the requirements of combat radio networks. This work is part of the basic research and development to support the implementation of NATO's Narrowband Waveform (NBWF).},

abstract={In tactical missions, seamless and effective communication is crucial for mission success. For future deployed networks, the user experience can be improved with proper resource allocation mechanisms, taking into consideration quality of service characteristics of the traffic. Such a resource allocation method requires knowledge of the key performance indicators of the communication path. In this article, we present a framework for the key performance indicator estimation service for deployed heterogeneous networks. Our proposal utilizes several different approaches for measuring key performance indicators. Several mechanisms are used to improve the accuracy and reliability of the service. We also discuss the lessons learned during the key performance indicator estimation service implementation and the validation process.},

abstract={Due to insufficient network infrastructure, tactical networks suffer the imbalance between network resource supply and transmission demands generated by deployed sensing devices. On top of that, those sensing devices are in multiple modalities with the need of fusing diverse inputs into unified formats to provide answers to query tasks. We addressed issues under network resource constraints on exploiting multiple distinctive sensing modalities. Then, we proposed a fusion framework to aggregate various types of sensing inputs, and an updating algorithm to adaptively schedule resource, e.g. bandwidth, to most contributing devices. With the adjustment of mapping functions which get bandwidth consumption bounded by the threshold, our algorithm keeps updating the combination of bandwidth shares to suit for streaming events as well as different query tasks. Taking multimodal sensing into account, our elementary fusion framework may shed light on deeper exploration on the correlation among variety of sensing inputs, especially under resource-constrained circumstances.},

volume={},

pages={6F1-1-6F1-11}, 
abstract={The allegory of the six blind men and the elephant applies well to Trajectory Based Operations (TBO). TBO definitions vary dependent on the previous experience and concept understanding of the groups concerned. This has led to a complete lack of specificity and resulted in developments that are discordant and which may even result in reinvention of 1930's concepts to the detriment of the aviation industries and the traveling public. This paper, based on previous and current research, develops a definition of TBO concepts of operation from first principles. Explains how early concepts for air traffic control had to deal with aircraft that were uncertain of their position and had limited navigation capability. These issues were managed by procedural control which was inefficient for the aircraft and the system but reduced the workload for controllers with limited automation support. Procedural control has been repeatedly enhanced since its inception in the 1930's, in particular by use of surveillance systems. However, these concepts of operation are now close to capacity and of low resilience. Furthermore, not only do modern aircraft have extremely accurate navigation systems, but now the workload for the tactical/radar controller is the limiting performance factor for the control system leading to non-optimal flights for aircraft in a non-optimal system. A systems analysis approach based on current capabilities allows definition of a TBO system where the operators are free to optimize their fleets, the aircraft are free to fly efficient trajectories and the controllers enable the flight optimization using four dimensional capable decision support tools and negotiation software. Not only does this lead to efficient flight by the aircraft but also increases system efficiency. This paper shows that each of the blind men actually correctly perceived part of TBO but the whole TBO system is more than the sum of the parts.},

year={2017},

pages={489-494}, 
abstract={NarrowBand Waveforms (NBWF) are often used in VHF or UHF tactical communications. For these kinds of waveforms, low latency and robust data rates result in short codeword lengths that are challenging in terms of channel coding. Usually, serially concatenated convolutional code and continuous phase modulation (CC-CPM) schemes are considered in the context of NBWF. When evaluating the achievable rates, CC-CPM schemes show a 1 to 4 dB maximum margin. In this paper, we investigate on two new sparse graph-based channel coding strategies, trying to reduce this degradation for the achievable rate. Some implementation issues with short codeword lengths are also addressed. To this end, we first consider a serially concatenated CPM scheme where the outer code is an optimized Low-Density Parity-Check code (LDPC) based on some recently introduced methods for this kind of applications. The optimized LDPC scheme exhibits a good bit error rate when binary CPMs are used. This new design comes with lower computational complexity and greater flexibility. Second, in order to avoid the cubersome of iterative detection and decoding, we investigate on recently introduced precoded CPM that can achieve near optimal performance, referred to us as Pragmatic CPM (P-CPM). For this kind of precoded CPM schemes, we will show that associated EXIT chart curves have the flat property. It means that, to achieve good performance, P-CPM can be used with standard capacity approaching codes like LDPC Accumulate Repeat Jagged Accumulate (ARJA) or Turbo Codes without the need for iterative decoding. Bit error rate simulations confirm that P-CPM is a reliable alternative NBWF scheme compatible with versatile modern channel codes. As P-CPM is non-iterative, implementation is made easier. In additive white Gaussian noise, both schemes are found practical.},

Further, the exchange of information and subsequent data analysis on the MHS makes the system intelligent and smart. In any standard battlefield scenario, there is a command and control center that correlates the events happening in real time. We have made this command and control center as semantic edge component. This center is entrusted with making vital decisions on the tactical arena of the battlefield. The main aim of the proposed architecture is to provide secured zone to monitor soldiers health and their weapons conditions, respectively. We have also introduced the semantic edge computing mechanism to deal with the large amount of health data in terms of processing, storing and sharing information.},

abstract={This paper examines the low-probability-of-exploitation (LPE) characteristics of a noncontiguous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (NC-OFDM) system. NC-OFDM transmission is similar to OFDM transmission but only uses a subset of the frequencies either to avoid incumbent transmissions or due to tactical considerations. This paper considers an NC-OFDM transmission with a given set of active subcarriers and examines how an eavesdropper can infer transmission parameters such as total duration of an NC-OFDM symbol, length of the cyclic prefix, etc., using tools like the cyclostationary analysis. Such an analysis reveals that difficulty in estimating the total nominal bandwidth of NC-OFDM transmissions (bandwidth that includes frequencies occupied by inactive subcarriers) poses a fundamental challenge in determining the correct sampling rate and the subsequent retrieval of the transmitted signal. The analysis also shows that the features of the cyclic autocorrelation function (CAF) of an NC-OFDM transmission depend closely on the set of active subcarriers. Procedures for inferring the transmission parameters from the CAF are discussed while noting that the choice of an interleaved set of subcarriers introduces additional ambiguity in determining the transmission parameters. A PCA-based offline timing recovery scheme is proposed and used as a guidepost in determining the minimum rate at which an active set of subcarriers must be refreshed to avoid easy exploitation. Finally, key advantages of an NC-OFDM system over an OFDM system from an LPE-standpoint are discussed and suggestions for an LPE-centric design of NC-OFDM systems are made.},

In previous work, we identified the vast computational challenges of solving this problem when considering the effects of cumulative co-channel interference. We present a new method to solve this problem using heuristic, integer optimization, and constraint programming techniques. We apply our methods to realistic data sets from a large U.S. Marine Corps combat scenario, and provide detailed performance results. We also outline our plan for further developing this method to consider multiple time steps.

abstract={Recently Underwater wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) have been suggested as a powerful technology for many civilian and military applications, such that tactical surveillance. Geographic routing that uses the position information of nodes to route the packet toward a destination is preferable for UWSNs. In this paper, we propose a New Greedy Forwarding (NGF) strategy using splitting mechanism based on Chinese remainder theorem(CRT) for UWSNs. In the approach, source node reduced the number of bits transmitted using the proposed splitting mechanism based on CRT if there are more than two nodes participate in the forwarding of one packet. This strategy distribute the forwarding task between more nodes instead of selecting one node as next-hop, that reduce the energy consumption per node and maintain node communication for a long time. Thus resulting the increase of network life time and decrease the number of isolated/void nodes. We use topology control through depth adjustment to cope with the problem of isolated and void nodes appeared in geographic routing protocols. Simulation results shows that with the anycast greedy forwarding strategy the network life time is about 500 rounds whereas it is about 1000 rounds using the new greedy forwarding strategy, which means the new strategy increase the network life time and increase the network performance in energy saving.},

abstract={New generation military equipment, soldiers and vehicles, use wireless technology to communicate on the battlefield. During missions, they form an ad hoc network, namely Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET). Since the battlefield includes coalition, each group may communicate with another group, and inter-MANET communication may be established. Inter-MANET (or interdomain MANET) communication should allow communication, but maintain a control on the exchanged information. Several protocols have been proposed in order to handle inter-domain routing for tactical MANETs. In this paper, we review these protocols and highlight the general issues they solve. Then, we compare the behavior of a simulator (NS3), an emulator (CORE) and a real platform (using laptops) on simple network characteristics at Network and Data Link layers level. We show that there are behavioral differences among these three validation tools, and particularly those based on softwares (NS3 and CORE), which create problems that does not exist in reality. Consequently, most existing protocols are more complex than they should be. Based on this analysis and real behavior, we propose some preconization to design Inter-domain protocols for MANET.},

Identified suitable and compatible data archives to support these comparisons.  Initial Results  While total delay between the two regions does not differ considerably, they apply conceptually different traffic management strategies.  The data suggest that delay TMIs in the US are used more often to manage airport capacity imbalances, whereas Europe is more focused on managing the airspace.  TMIs in the US are smaller in number and target a smaller number of flights which are severely impacted, while in Europe the number of initiatives is larger and the impact of such initiatives is spread over a significantly higher number of airspace users with an average delay per delayed flight that is 50% less than that in the US.  The much smaller number of TMIs used in the US are more apt to be re-evaluated once initiated, whereas initiatives in Europe are less likely to be shortened.},

title={Context-aware Smallworld Routing for Wireless Ad-hoc Networks}, 
year={2018}, 
volume={PP}, 
number={99}, 
pages={1-1}, 
abstract={We propose a Context-aware Smallworld routing protocol for wireless ad-hoc networks which finds efficient routes to destination nodes often through a very short chain of intermediate nodes, without using any routing table. This protocol exploits the “small-world” phenomenon of social networks where source-destination pairs typically get connected through few intermediate friends and the individuals can collectively discover such short paths. The key idea behind our routing protocol is that for forwarding an incoming packet to the destination, a node picks the next hop from among the one-hop neighbor from its one-hop neighborhood that is closest to the destination, and multiple randomly selected long-distance neighbor(s), i.e., from outside of its one-hop neighborhood, based on which of these neighbors is closest to the destination. The long-distance neighbors are selected by using their contextual information through a probabilistic mapping. We provide the theoretical foundations behind our protocol. This simple but effective algorithm can meet performance objectives for most scenarios by reducing loss and latency. Simulation results, using synthetic network topologies, have demonstrated that the routing performance of context-aware Smallworld is better than geographical (distance-based) Smallworld and other standard proactive routing protocols (e.g., OLSRv2) when metrics like packet losses, end-to-end delays, hop-counts, connectivity drops and control traffic generated are used as the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). We also show that the proposed protocol is resilient to dynamic topology changes.},

abstract={We introduce competing cognitive resilient network (CCRN) of mobile radios challenged to optimize data throughput and networking efficiency under dynamic spectrum access and adversarial threats (e.g., jamming). Unlike the conventional approaches, CCRN features both communicator and jamming nodes in a friendly coalition to take joint actions against hostile networking entities. In particular, this paper showcases hypothetical blue force and red force CCRNs and their competition for open spectrum resources. We present state-agnostic and stateful solution approaches based on the decision theoretic framework. The state-agnostic approach builds on multiarmed bandit to develop an optimal strategy that enables the exploratory-exploitative actions from sequential sampling of channel rewards. The stateful approach makes an explicit model of states and actions from an underlying Markov decision process and uses multiagent Q-learning to compute optimal node actions. We provide a theoretical framework for CCRN and propose new algorithms for both approaches. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithms outperform some of the most important algorithms known to date.},

abstract={This letter proposes a novel protocol that uses Q-learning-based geographic routing (QGeo) to improve the network performance of unmanned robotic networks. A rapid and reliable network is essential for the remote control and monitoring of mobile robotic devices. However, controlling the network overhead required for route selection and repair is still a notable challenge, owing to high mobility of the devices. To alleviate this problem, we propose a machine-learning-based geographic routing scheme to reduce network overhead in high-mobility scenarios. We evaluate the performance of QGeo in comparison with other methods using the NS-3 simulator. We find that QGeo has a higher packet delivery ratio and a lower network overhead than existing methods.},

title={Modeling and Analysis of Energy Efficiency and Interference for Cellular Relay Deployment},

abstract={By relying on a wireless backhaul link, relay stations enhance the performance of cellular networks by achieving the required reliability at a savings of infrastructure cost and energy, but at the same time, they can aggravate the interference issue. In this paper, we analyze the maximum energy gain provided by relays for several coding schemes, including energy-optimized partial decode-forward relaying, accounting for the additional relay-generated interference to neighboring cells. First, we define new energy-efficient service areas for relaying in log-normal shadowing environments and propose easily computable and tractable models to predict: 1) the probability of energy-efficient relaying; 2) the spatial distribution of energy consumption within a cell; and 3) the average interference generated by relays. These models allow finding the optimal location and the number of relays with significantly lower complexity and execution time, as compared with system simulations. Finally, we analyze the gains provided by more advanced relaying coding schemes and propose a map showing how to use them across a cell, as a function of their respective circuitry consumption. The inclusion of more advanced relaying schemes not only alleviates the interference issue, but also leads to a reduction in the number of relays required for the same rate and outage performance.},
