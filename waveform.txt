In the type of system we consider, multiple user terminals transmit to a satellite using a coordinated frequency hopping waveform, and the received signals are relayed to a ground processing “hub” terminal for baseband processing
The system is fully software defined and capable of transmitting and receiving a linearly stepped frequency waveform between 1GHz and 4GHz with reconfigurable frequency hop and sweep rates
The fundamental problem is the lack of ideal ambiguity properties of the available waveforms
OCP consists of a master agent with a single instantiation at each node, and multiple radio agents one for each waveform type a node has
Simulation results show that the waveforms obtained using the proposed scheme outperform the previous waveforms including the JTIDS waveform with respect to both the multinet capability and the data rate
On the other side, with recent technologies, radar systems become adaptive and intelligent systems that can change their waveforms
This proposal introduces a wideband non-contiguous waveform that offers more reliability thanks to the introduction of frequency diversity and also is able to reach throughputs in excess of 150kb/s
This waveform, called “HF XL” proposes to use Turbo codes instead of traditional convolutional codes as forward error correction (FEC) coding scheme
The latest data waveforms use channels wider than 3 kHz to boost data throughput and robustness
This has driven the need for a more capable Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) system that links faster and adapts the wideband HF (WBHF) waveform to efficiently use available spectrum
A recent study has introduced a new spread spectrum waveform based on filter bank multicarrier techniques
The proposed waveform that is called FB-MC-SS offers the advantages of simple implementation and robust performance when it is subject to narrow/partial band interference
Also, an algorithm for optimizing the peak to average power ratio (PAPR) of the FB-MC-SS waveform is presented
Application of this algorithm results in a waveform with a very low PAPR of about 4 dB

This paper proposes a technique for intercepting the symmetric signals and uses the example of the widely used Triangular FM waveform as a case study, due to its importance
Due to the symmetric nature of the Triangular FM waveform, the output of this self-convolution procedure is the same as the autocorrelation function of the Triangular FM waveform with a slightly higher sidelobe pedestal due to added noise
The higher sidelobe pedestal results in incurring a small SNR loss which is the price paid for blind interception of the triangular FM waveform
The derived expressions may be helpful in gaining insight on the statistical properties of band-limited digital signal waveforms
Two generations (so called 2G and 3G ALE) have been standardized since the 90s, and are today being revisited due to the emergence of wideband HF waveforms
Testing existing or developing new military waveforms requires computationally efficient simulations to allow for large scenarios that would not be feasible with hardware
The long delays require extensive equalization of a single carrier wideband waveform, and for a typical high data rate 5 MHz waveform at UHF, the required equalizer depth was found to be more than 100 symbol periods
These predicted channels are combined with instantaneous channel estimation from received signals to calculate signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and link rate (using analytical waveform models)
A framework for designing covert sonar waveform and assessment of its steganographic security for sonar applications is presented, based on a model for the underwater ambient acoustic environment the waveform is intended to hide under
Adopting the lessons from the steganography literature, steganographic security is measured not by evaluating performance against potential intercept detectors, but by measuring the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the background model and the model of the background perturbed by the candidate waveform

As electromagnetic spectrum availability shrinks, there is growing interest in combining multiple functions, such as radar and communications signals, into a single multipurpose waveform
This research explores an alternative approach of implementing an in-band, mixed-modulated waveform that combines surveillance radar and communication functions into a single signal
There have been many proposed waveform designs that attempt to resolve this ambiguity, however, the problem is aggravated as the number of targets grows
Existing approaches for multitarget detection use waveforms of limited configurability, such as up-down chirps separated by CW segments for measuring Doppler
In this paper, we propose a chirp diversity pulse train waveform and the associated detector structure that isolates the returns that lie within one pulse interval
Furthermore, the waveform is tuned to resolve delay-Doppler coupling of multiple targets with no need for a separate CW segment often used to solve for Doppler
Polyphase codes based on linear FM (LFM) and piecewise LFM (PLFM) waveforms are used as chips for the complementary code pair, since they satisfy both the conjugate symmetry/anti-symmetry and the quasi-orthogonality conditions
Such sets are constructed using polyphase code sets based on LFM and PLFM waveforms as chips
Our experiments show that centralizing the intelligence in the MEC allows to guarantee the requirements of the tactical applications either by adapting the waveform parameters, or through changing the radio interface or even by reconfiguring the applications

Waveform specifications provide little intuition as to how to overcome these
This allows us to use a waveform generator and a digitizer with relatively lower sample rates and significantly lowers the cost compared to sampling the whole band at once
To fully leverage the expanded space resources, the DoD must also address the integration of commercial waveforms into the DoD tactical terminals
