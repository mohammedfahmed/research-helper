distributed protocol that supports directional spectrum reuse for ..... waveforms
This protocol was developed as an add-on module to a distributed resources manager designed to provide MANET nodes with neighborhood spectrum utilization information, as well as perform dynamic negotiation of the available shared spectrum
The protocol utilizes spectrum awareness messaging that is defined per each channel and per TDMA slot
This protocol allows each node to allocate resources (channel and slot) based on demand without interfering with existing users of that channel and slot while maximally reusing spectrum resources
In this paper, we propose a missing spectrum data recovery technique for cognitive radio (CR) networks using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
It is shown that the spectrum measurements collected from secondary users (SUs) can be factorized as product of a channel gain matrix times an activation matrix
Then, an NMF method with piecewise constant activation coefficients is introduced to analyze the measurements and estimate the missing spectrum data
The numerical simulation verifies that the proposed technique is able to accurately estimate the missing spectrum data in the presence of noise and fading
Spectral efficiency (SE), defined as the average data rate per unit bandwidth, quantifies how efficiently the available spectrum is utilized
Basically, with higher average energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio at the receiver, the packet can be more successfully detected, thus utilizing the spectrum more efficiently, giving higher SE; however, in this case, it requires more energy, lowering EE, and vice versa
In the static and exclusive spectrum allocation paradigm, the spectrum-access parameters for a service are chosen to mitigate potential harmful-interference and ensure minimum performance under worst-case conditions
The new dynamic spectrum-sharing paradigm necessitates dynamically defining and enforcing the spectrum-access rights while accommodating the dynamics of the RF environment and the spectrum-access scenarios
To enforce spectrum-access rights, we emphasize capturing the use of spectrum by an individual transceiver
We propose to articulate the spectrum-access rights in terms of the characterization of the spectrum used by an individual transceiver in the space, time, and frequency dimensions
In order to estimate the use of spectrum in real time, we employ a dedicated RF-sensor network that uses interference-tolerant algorithms to estimate the transceiver spectrum-access parameters and to characterize the propagation environment
We illustrate defining and enforcing a spectrum-access policy and we bring out its advantages for dynamic spectrum sharing
In order to reduce sampling costs and computational complexity in the signal reconstruction process of existing compressed spectrum sensing (CSS), we propose a novel two-step compressed spectrum sensing (TS-CSS) scheme exploiting correlation of occupation states between sensing periods

Signal detection and RF parameter estimation have received great interest in recent years due to the need for spectrum sensing in rapidly growing cognitive radio and cyber security research
In most conventional signal detection and RF parameter estimation work, the target signal is often assumed to be a single primary user signal without overlap in spectrum with other signals
However, in a spectrally congested environment or a spectrally contested environment which often occurs in cyber security applications, multiple signals are often mixed together with significant overlap in spectrum
In our previous work, we have demonstrated the feasibility of using a second order spectrum correlation function (SCF) cyclostationary feature to perform mixed signal detection, but the detection was confined to BPSK modulation
This paper presents a novel method for generating a secret key to augment the security of spread spectrum systems

In spectrum trading, secondary users bid for the spectrum units being made available by primary users
Auction theory has been widely applied to improve spectrum allocation in such spectrum trading scenarios

In this work, we investigate a realistic dynamic auction environment where secondary users with diverse delay bounds arrive dynamically, and spectrum becomes available at random
We illustrate the properties of the mechanism in terms of spectrum utilization rate, bidder satisfaction rate, and average bidder utility through extensive simulations
Bandwidth allocation in spectrum-congested wire- less content delivery networks should be performed based on the user's Quality of Experience (QoE)

The ability to provide accurate spectrum sensing and decision making under an uncertainty environment is proving useful for the military SATCOM to increases the spectrum utilization
Dynamic spectrum access(DSA) allows a secondary user to access the spectrum holes that are not occupied by the primary users
However, the spectrum sensing for DSA is normally performed in a complex SATCOM environment under uncertainty, caused by the high GEO/LEO mobility, weak signals after a long distance of propagation, the high interference and jamming in an adversarial environment, etc
The uncertainty results in a high error probability in the spectrum sensing
In this paper, we propose an approach for optimal spectrum sensing and decision making that mathematically models the uncertainty in the SATCOM while the whole system throughput is maximized
