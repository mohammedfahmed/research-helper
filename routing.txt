multicast routing protocol for wireless mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) that uses distribution trees to efficiently forward multicast traffic
The proposed multicast routing protocol is built as a MANET extension to the popular Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) routing protocol used in wired networks; hence, we call our scheme PIM-MANET
Similar to PIM, PIM-MANET is agnostic of the unicast routing protocol that is used to connect users in the network
PIM-MANET extends PIM to the wireless domain by implementing required features such as Duplicate Packet Detection (DPD) to avoid routing loops, removing extraneous messaging, and using a novel tree creation mechanism to form multicast trees that achieve better performance in presence of asymmetric links
We implement the PIM-MANET protocol as a routing daemon for the Linux environment and show the benefits of our approach over currently used MANET multicast protocols
Although many routing algorithms for DTNs have been proposed, prior works generally focus on optimizing delivery ratio and cost by finding the relay node with the highest delivery probability to the destination
Since current heuristic-based routing algorithms bias toward connectivity, highly connected nodes have a high probability to be selected by other nodes as their next hop
In this paper, we provide empirical experiments to show the natural load imbalance of existing routing algorithms
We then introduce Load Balanced Social-Tie Routing (LBR), a routing strategy in which messages are favorably forwarded to network nodes that have both a stronger social tie with the destination and a smaller or similar queue length
Meanwhile, LBR distributes the load more evenly with the top 10% of network nodes handling 23% of the forwardings, compared to 37% for Epidemic routing, 43% for PROPHET, and 47% for BubbleRap
Our contribution is a routing protocol which targets these challenges
The problem of routing in mobile ad hoc wireless networks that employ directional antennas is contrasted with the more familiar problems of routing in conventional wired networks and routing in wireless networks that employ omni-directional antennas
An example is developed to highlight novel aspects of the network routing problem that come into play when directional antennas are introduced
A game theoretic analysis of this example, which interprets routing as a strategy adopted by message flows, sheds some light on how the kind of routing that best serves directional networks is fundamentally different from conventional routing
Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) has many advantages over other routing protocols for use within MANETs
This paper discusses the augmentation of OLSR with a reactive routing algorithm referred to as Priority Aware Dynamic Routing (PADR)
PADR along with OLSR forms a hybrid routing approach where routes may be chosen based on metrics that are difficult to account for by proactive routing alone; such as mobility, changing mission needs, dynamic resource allocation, and RF contention
The proposed hybrid approach is designed to operate at the cipher text IP layer and is capable of routing over a single MANET subnet or over multiple heterogeneous subnets
Traditionally, Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is considered the de facto standard inter-domain routing protocol
A more scalable approach is to develop a new inter-domain routing protocol that fundamentally addresses BGP protocol limitations

NS3 simulation analysis shows that the packet delivery ratio for the aeronautical routing protocol AeroRP decreased to up to 50%, depending on attack type and number of attackers
These services are usually provided by proactive routing protocols with Multipoint Relay (MPR) technology
In this paper, we quantify the impact of commonly used algorithms at the routing and the scheduling layers on the overall network throughput and compare their individual effects on overall network throughput performance
We consider the routing and the scheduling layers separately since practical MANET implementations are likely to use a layered architecture even though the joint routing and scheduling algorithm is known to be optimal
Our data shows that a good scheduling algorithm can provide potentially four times the throughput improvement of a good routing algorithm when inter-user interference conforms to an 802
In particular, the relays for routing and the degree of link padding at each relay are chosen to optimize the tradeoff between anonymity from timing analysis, as measured by Shannon entropy of source destination pairs, and the average latency
MCONF does not rely on specific routing or medium access protocols, and therefore can work with a wide range of network and link layer technologies
In this model, routing is formulated in a distributed setting where each node operating with local information only finds the next-hop node, among all social and mobile ad hoc network (MANET) communication link neighbors, whose normalized delay is the smallest

Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) is a popular protocol for proactively establishing peer-to-peer links in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs)
Our results show that the commercial off-the-shelf implementations of the OLSR protocol are not resilient to unwanted interference leading a MANET to potential denial or degradation if its routing protocol were targeted
Since routing in MSNs depends heavily on the cooperation among participating nodes, selfish or malicious behaviors of nodes impact strongly on the routing performance
Then, we propose SSRS, a novel social-based secure routing strategy, which exploits social relationships to enhance routing security and performance
The solution separates wired IP routing from routing in the radio network and applies cross-layer address management to efficiently map and distribute IP routes
This calls for routing protocols that can quickly and efficiently route the application traffic to their destinations
This paper proposes a distance-based routing protocol, named as Smallworld, which finds efficient routes to target nodes often through a very short chain of intermediate nodes, without using any routing table like other standard routing protocols
The key idea behind this routing protocol is that for forwarding an incoming packet to the destination, a node picks the next hop from between a one-hop neighbor, from its one-hop neighborhood that is closest to the destination, and a randomly selected long-distance neighbor, i

GCN's performance is compared against multiple popular wireless routing protocols, which we also run over-the-air
These tests yield two notable results: (1) the seemingly benign environment of an office is in fact quite lossy, with high packet error rates between users that are geographically close to one another, and (2) that GCN does indeed offer high delivery with low network overhead, which is in contrast to traditional wireless routing schemes that offer either high delivery or low overhead, or sometimes neither
For military applications, routing of information across a communication network has typically been accomplished using fixed, a priori defined, routing paths
However, in bandwidth constrained environments, when not all information is able to be routed across the network, then fixed routing paths presents limitations in information reaching appropriate consumers
In this research, we consider the advantages to using dynamic shortest temporal path routes for the information, as opposed to fixed routing paths

This paper studies the problem of routing in a multilayer (communication and social) network
Network protocols, such as link state routing and its variants, heavily used in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) cannot sustain robustness and efficiency as the topological information becomes easily stale with fast network dynamics
This paper presents the SCATE (Social-Cognitive Advancement at Tactical Edge) routing protocol that applies social-cognitive techniques to improve robustness and efficiency of a multilayer network with MANET communication and social links
In a distributed and decentralized setting with local information, nodes learn and update their distances to destinations using social-cognitive metrics and make routing decisions to minimize the end-to-end delay
The SCATE protocol is compared with Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) with and without social links
Results show that the SCATE protocol is a viable solution to MANET routing by substantially reducing the overhead and the end-to-end delay, and increasing the end-to-end delivery ratio for both unicast and multicast traffic

In mobile Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs), the frequent link breakage and wireless interference urged the need for novel stable routing solutions
In this paper, we propose STAR, a stable routing protocol that aims at selecting interference-free and durable paths
