The 2010 Joint Space Communication Layer (JSCL) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) forecasts a large demand increase for US MILSATCOM in contested environments during the 2020-2025 timeframe
 However, in a spectrally congested environment or a spectrally contested environment which often occurs in cyber security applications, multiple signals are often mixed together with significant overlap in spectrum
Collaborative autonomy of unmanned air-vehicles (UA) in harsh or contested environments is a challenging and increasingly important problem
 However, not much work has been devoted to developing a systematic cross-layer framework that lends itself well to housing alternative cross-layer design algorithms for contested networks that are of interest to the Army
 In this paper, we describe a flexible, modular and extensible cross-layer framework that can be used both in contested and benign environments to design robust multi-tiered ad hoc communications networks
 When a network operates in a contested environment, the operator may wish to alter the network topology to enhance robustness
Jamming is an ongoing threat that plagues wireless communications in contested areas
Parameter optimization such as power and time allocation plays an important role in emerging cooperative relaying protocol designs, especially when the environment is congested and contested
In communication-denied scenarios or contested environments, Line-of-sight(LoS) communication (by infrared or visible light) becomes one of the most reliable ways to send information between mobile units
 Security in terms of measurement integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity is an area of interest because OBAN system components exchange sensitive data in contested environments
Today, rapid business and technology innovations are producing an array of advanced commercial satellite communications (COMSATCOM) systems that can deliver massive amounts of SATCOM capacity at a fraction of current cost and offer communications diversity that is critical for achieving resilience in a military contested environment
 In this paper we examine how the architecture can provide an agile swarming approach to data ferrying to facilitate information exchange in a highly contested radio frequency (RF) environment
The inherent nature of unattended sensors makes these devices most vulnerable to detection, exploitation, and denial in contested environments
